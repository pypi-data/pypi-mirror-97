===============
 Failing Tests
===============

The tests included in the folders here are known to fail for various
reasons.

Some of them will never be fixed for evident reasons (animations or
interactions, for example), they are in the "na" folder. Some of them are
really difficult to fix (raster filters, linking), some of them may not be bugs
(draft tests), and the other ones must be fixed.

You'll find in each folder an explaination about why the tests are failing and
what can be done to fix them.
