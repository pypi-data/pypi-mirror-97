1.Python routines rely on DkamSDK.

Before running the routine, install the appropriate version of DkamSDK.

2.This routine is suitable for both Python 2 (Python 2.7) and Python 3 (Python 3.6, Python 3.7, Python 3.8, and Python 3.9). 

Before running the routine, you need to install Python and set Python information in the system environment variables.

3.The Python example mainly demonstrates the following functions:

- DiscoverCamera
- Connect/Disconnect Camera
- StreamOn/StreamOff Camera
- Set Trigger Mode/Set RGB Trigger Mode
- Set Trigger Source
- Set Trigger Count/Set RGB Trigger Count
- Save Pointcloud、Gray、RGB、FilterPointcloud、Depth、FusionImagePointcloudAndRGB、FusionImagePointcloudAndGray、ROIMapping
- Set ROI
- Write/Read Register
- Get Camera Internel/Externel Parameter
- Set Gain
- Get Time stamp
- Set ROI Mapping

4.Attention.

   Python can only run routines that correspond to bits. That is, 32-bit Python runs 32-bit routines (not yet supported), and 64-bit Python runs 64-bit routines.
