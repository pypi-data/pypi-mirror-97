# Eliatopia_Library
An easy made library to get data from Eliatopia's api keys.

## Quick Example
```py
from Eliatopia_Library.elia import Eliatopia

Eliatopia = Eliatopia("0.0.1") #must specify the version or else you will get a error.

Eliatopia.getOnline() #this will print the amount of players that are currently in game.
```

### Example in a discord bot made in discord.

```py
import discord
from discord.ext import commands
from Eliatopia_Library.elia import Eliatopia

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="prefix", description="some random stuff.")

@bot.event
	print("{}\n{}".format(bot.user, bot.user.id))

@bot.command()
async def showPlayers(ctx):
	await Eliatopia.getOnlineDiscord(ctx) #must add ctx between the paranthesis as we're using it in discord.py

bot.run(token, bot=True)

#current working functions.

getOnline() #displays the amount of online players
getOnlineDiscord(ctx) #sends the amount of online players in a discord channel where the command its executed.
getServerTime() #displays the current server time (the game's server time)
getServerTimeDiscord(ctx) #sends the game's server time in a discord channel where the command its executed.
getLeaderboard(player)	#displays a player's statistics in the console (must specify the player's name)
getLeaderboardDiscord(ctx, player) #sends a player's statistics in a discord server (must specify the player's name)
```

## This library will be updated soon as those aint all the functions.
## Hope you will enjoy! :)
