Description: Welcome to Intrinsic Physiology Feature Extractor (IPFX)
        ==========================================
        
        IPFX is a Python package for computing intrinsic cell features from electrophysiology data. With this package you can:
        
        - Perform cell data quality control (e.g. resting potential stability)
        - Detect action potentials and their features (e.g. threshold time and voltage)
        - Calculate features of spike trains (e.g., adaptation index)
        - Calculate stimulus-specific cell features
        
        This software is designed for use in the Allen Institute for Brain Science electrophysiology data processing pipeline.

        Deprecation Warning
        -------------------
        The 1.0.0 release of ipfx brings some new features, like NWB2 support, along with improvements to our documentation and testing. We will also drop support for
        - NWB1
        - Python 2
        
        Older versions of ipfx will continue to be available, but may receive only occasional bugfixes and patches.
