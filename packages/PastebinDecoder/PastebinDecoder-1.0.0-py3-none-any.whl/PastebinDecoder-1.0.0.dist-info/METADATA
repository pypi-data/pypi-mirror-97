# PastebinDecoder

This is intended to be a helper method to determine if a given paste is encoded in some way (base64, etc). Some of
the examples are modifed from the Ixia blog post at https://www.ixiacom.com/company/blog/hiding-plain-sight-decoding-malware-pastebin ,
others are ones I've run across as I've worked with pastebin data.
