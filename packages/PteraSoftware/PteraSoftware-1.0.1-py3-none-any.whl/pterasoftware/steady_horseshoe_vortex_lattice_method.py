    This class contains the following public methods:
        run: Run the solver on the steady problem.
        initialize_panel_vortices: This method calculates the locations of the vortex vertices, and then initializes the
                                   panels' vortices.
        collapse_geometry: This method converts attributes of the problem's geometry into 1D ndarrays. This facilitates
                           vectorization, which speeds up the solver.
        calculate_wing_wing_influences: This method finds the matrix of wing-wing influence coefficients associated with
                                        this airplane's geometry.
        calculate_freestream_wing_influences: Find the normal velocity speed at every collocation points without the
                                              influence of the vortices.
        calculate_vortex_strengths: Solve for each panels' vortex strengths.
