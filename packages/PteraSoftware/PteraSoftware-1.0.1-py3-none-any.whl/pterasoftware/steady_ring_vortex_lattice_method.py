    This class contains the following public methods:
        run: Run the solver on the steady problem.
        initialize_panel_vortices: This method calculates the locations of the vortex vertices, and then initializes the
                                   panels' vortices.
        collapse_geometry: This method converts attributes of the problem's geometry into 1D ndarrays. This facilitates
                           vectorization, which speeds up the solver.
        calculate_wing_wing_influences: This method finds the matrix of wing-wing influence coefficients associated with
                                        this airplane's geometry.
        calculate_freestream_wing_influences: This method finds the vector of freestream-wing influence coefficients
                                              associated with this problem.
        calculate_vortex_strengths: This method solves for each panel's vortex strength.
        calculate_solution_velocity: This function takes in a group of points. At every point, it finds the induced
                                     velocity due to every vortex and the freestream velocity.
        calculate_near_field_forces_and_moments: This method finds the the forces and moments calculated from the near
                                                 field.
        calculate_streamlines: This method calculates the location of the streamlines coming off the back of the wings.
