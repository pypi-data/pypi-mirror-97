This is Ptera Software: a fast, easy-to-use, and open-source package for analyzing flapping wing flight.

## Motivation

In late 2018, I became curious about biological flight. To sate this curiosity, I wanted to computationally simulate
some flapping wing fliers. I quickly realized I had two options:

1. Spend thousands of dollars on a closed-source CFD program, which would take hours to solve a simple case.
2. Try to learn someone else's open-source, unsteady solver written in a language I didn't know, and using a framework
   that is overly complicated for my use case.

Neither of these seemed like the right choice.

Thankfully, my friend, Peter Sharpe, had just released his own open-source aerodynamics solver: AeroSandbox. With his
blessing, I have used AeroSandbox as a jumping-off point to develop a solver package capable of unsteady simulations.

Through the combined efforts of Peter Sharpe, Suhas Kodali, and me, Ptera Software was born. It is the only easy-to-use,
open-source, and actively-maintained UVLM package I know capable of analyzing flapping wing flight. Moreover, it's
written in Python, is well documented, and is well tested.

With your help, I hope we will increase the open-source community's interest and understanding of biological flight.

## How to Install

First things first, you will need a copy of Python 3.7.6 or 3.7.7. Download it from the official Python website. At this
time, I do not recommend using a version from the Anaconda distribution as it could introduce compatibility issues with
PyPI.

There are a few ways to install Ptera Software. If you wish to use this package as a dependency in your own projects,
simply run:

```pip install PteraSoftware```

via the command prompt in your project's directory.

If you just want to play around with the software, feel free to fork this repository and open the source code in the IDE
of your choice. You will then need to run:

```pip install -r REQUIREMENTS.txt```

via the command prompt in your fork's directory.

### Requirements

Here are the requirements necessary to run Ptera Software:

* matplotlib >= 3.2.2, < 4.0.0
* numpy >= 1.18.5, < 1.19.0
* pyvista >= 0.25.3, < 1.0.0
* scipy >= 1.5, < 2.0

### What if I am Having Trouble Getting the Package Up And Running?

Not to worry! I am working on a video that walks through getting Ptera Software up and running. It will include every
step, from downloading Python for the first time to setting up your IDE to running the software. Feel free to reach out
for guidance. You can reach me at camerongurban@gmail.com.

## How to Use

By reading this file, you are already off to a good start! After installing Ptera Software in the way that best suits
your use case, the next step would be to open the "examples" directory and read through each heavily commented script.
Each one will give you insight into the software's interface. After you finish reading, try running the scripts and
admiring their pretty output!

## Example Code

The following code snippet is all that is needed (after running pip install pterasoftware) to run the steady horseshoe
solver on a custom airplane object.

```
import pterasoftware as ps

example_airplane = ps.geometry.Airplane(
    wings=[
        ps.geometry.Wing(
            symmetric=True,
            wing_cross_sections=[
                ps.geometry.WingCrossSection(
                    airfoil=ps.geometry.Airfoil(name="naca2412",),
                ),
                ps.geometry.WingCrossSection(
                    y_le=5.0, airfoil=ps.geometry.Airfoil(name="naca2412",),
                ),
            ],
        ),
    ],
)

example_operating_point = ps.operating_point.OperatingPoint()

example_problem = ps.problems.SteadyProblem(
    airplane=example_airplane, operating_point=example_operating_point,
)

example_solver = ps.steady_horseshoe_vortex_lattice_method.SteadyHorseshoeVortexLatticeMethodSolver(
    steady_problem=example_problem
)

example_solver.run()

ps.output.draw(
    solver=example_solver, show_delta_pressures=True, show_streamlines=True,
)
```

## Example Output

This package currently supports three different solvers, a steady horseshoe vortex lattice method (VLM), a steady ring
VLM, and an unsteady ring VLM (UVLM). Here are examples of the output you can expect to receive from each of them.

### Steady Horseshoe VLM

## Validation

With the release of version 1.0.0, Ptera Software is now validated against experimental flapping wing data! See the
"validation" directory to run the test case and read a report on the software's accuracy.

## How to Contribute

As I said before, the primary goal of this project is to increase the open-source community's understanding and 
appreciation for unsteady aerodynamics in general and flapping wing flight in particular. This will only happen through
your participation. Feel free to request features, report bugs and security issues, and provide suggestions. No comment
is too big or small!

Here is a list of changes I would like to make in the coming releases. If you want to contribute and don't know where to
start, this is for you!

### Testing

* We should make sure that all the integration tests compare output against expected results. This means getting rid of 
  all the "test_method_does_not_throw" tests.
* We should eventually reach and maintain 100% testing coverage.

### Style and Documentation

* Ideally, we should fix up the style so that the entire repository has an A+ CodeFactor Rating.
* We should fill in any of the "Properly document this..." TODO statements.
* We should ensure that all files have between 30% and 70% comment lines.
* We should continue to ensure that all source code is formatted using Black.

### Features

* We should create a setup tutorial video and add it to the documentation. This should be geared toward a user who
  doesn't have Python, an IDE, or Ptera Software installed on their computer yet.
* We should create a conda-forge package to increase our number of potential users.
* We should implement a leading-edge separation model to account for flow separation. See "Modified Unsteady
  Vortex-Lattice Method to Study Flapping Wings in Hover Flight." by Bruno Roccia, Sergio Preidikman, Julio Massa, and
  Dean Mook for details.
* We should create a command-line interface or GUI.
* We should try to implement aeroelastic effects in Ptera Software's solvers.
* Flapping wing controls is both fascinating and complicated. We should try to create a workflow in Ptera Software for
controls systems identification for flapping wing vehicles.

## Notes

To the best of my ability, I am following SemVer conventions in naming my releases. I am also using the GitFlow method
of branching for this project's development. This means that nightly builds will be available on the develop branch. The
latest stable releases can be found on the master branch.
