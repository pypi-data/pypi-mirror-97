        Pretty rendering method for mathematic functions
        
        ## Install
        
        From Pypi:
        
        `py -m pip install PyMathRender`
        
        From GitHub:
        
        `py -m pip install git+https://github.com/donno2048/Maths`
        
        ## Use
        
        ```py
        from PyMathRender import main
        main("sum([math.cos(3 ** n * x / 1000) / (3 ** n) for n in range(10)])", Text = r"$\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{\cos\left(3^nx\right)}{3^n}$ Is continuous but not differentiable in any point", LineColor = "blue", TextColor = "blue", start = 0, end = 10, step = .001, required = ["math"])
        ```
        
        Or:
        
        ```py
        from PyMathRender import main
        from math import cos, e, sqrt
        def fun(x): return sum([cos(3 ** n * x / 1000) / (e ** (sqrt(3 ** n) - 1)) for n in range(10)])
        main(fun, Text = r"$\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{\cos\left(3^nx\right)}{e^{-1+\sqrt{3^n}}}$ Is smooth but not analytic in any point", LineColor = "red", TextColor = "red", start = 0, end = 10, step = .001)
        ```
        
        The first argument is the function (`x` is the variable if you use the string method) - It is the only required argument,
        
        `Text` is the additional text,
        
        `LineColor` is the color of the line plotted, either `blue`, `green`, `red`, `cyan`, `magenta`, `yellow`, `black` or `white`,
        
        `TextColor` is the color of the additional text, same colors as LineColor,
        
        `start`, `end` and `step` are the starting and ending points and the size of the steps between them,
        
        `required` is a list of required packages for the function - needed only using the string method.
