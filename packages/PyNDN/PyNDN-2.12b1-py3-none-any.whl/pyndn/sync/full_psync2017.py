This modules defines the FullPSync2017 class which extends PSyncProducerBase to
implement the full sync logic of PSync to synchronize with other nodes, where
all nodes want to sync all the names. The application should call publishName
whenever it wants to let consumers know that a new name is available. Currently,
fetching and publishing the data given by the announced name needs to be handled
by the application. The Full PSync protocol is described in Section G "Full-Data
Synchronization" of:
https://named-data.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/scalable_name-based_data_synchronization.pdf
(Note: In the PSync library, this class is called FullProducerArbitrary. But
because the class actually handles both producing and consuming, we omit
"producer" in the name to avoid confusion.)
