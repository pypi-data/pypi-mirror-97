## ReferenceDataAccess
A python wrapper for accessing Reference data using RduAccess API's. 
To get more details on it, Please refer https://rduaccess.smartstreamrdu.com/getting-started

## RduAccess
RduAccess provides an easier way of accessing reference data over different asset type (Future, Options, Strategies, Equity, etc) using Rest Api, popularly known as RduAccess.

You can find all the api's at https://rduaccess.smartstreamrdu.com/. 
It also has a limited period free version for accessing the data.


## Purpose of ReferenceDataAccess
Accessing data from Rest API would typically involve below steps
* Call the respective rest api to fetch the json data
* Parse the Json Data and extract the required attributes 
* Use these attributes value to integrate it with your application.

RduAccess also provides rest api to fetch the data. However to integrate with your python application, you would also have to do above steps.

The intention of this library is to encapsulate all the above steps and give a simpler way of fetching the data from RduAccess into pandas dataframe. Once you have the data attributes in dataframe, you can easily integrate it with your application.


## Install
To install the package use:
```shell
pip install ReferenceDataAccess
```
Or install with pandas support, simply install pandas too:
```shell
pip install ReferenceDataAccess pandas
```
Note - Pandas version should be atleast 1.0.3 

## News
* From version 0.0.1.1, support to fetch reference data for Derivatives(Future, Options and Strategies) asset type .
* From version 0.0.1.3, added a method to get the output column's description, and the methods can now take an optional paramter, column_list, where you can specify the output column's.
* From version 0.0.3, added support to fetch reference data for Equity.

## Usage

# Etd - Derivative Data

To get data from the API, simply import the library and call the object with your API key. Next, get ready for some high quality reference data. 
You may get a key from https://rduaccess.smartstreamrdu.com/
```python
from dataAccess.EtdApi import EtdApi
etd = EtdApi(key="<<your key>>")

```
There are various api's through which data can be fetch
* Fetch By Isin
* Fetch By ticker and exchange code.
* Fetch By Isin along with underlying data

Example of fetch by isin.
Replace the isin with the isin for which data needs to be fetched
```
data = etd.get_by_isin(isin='ISIN')
```




Example of fetch by ticker and exchange code
```
dt = etd.get_by_ticker('ticker', 'exchange code') 
```

Example of fetch by isin along with underlying data - It fetches the etd data along with the underlying data
Replace the isin with the isin for which data needs to be fetched
```
data = etd.get_by_isin_with_underlier_data(isin='ISIN')
```



The above methods also has an option of passing an optional parameter column_list, where we can specify the list column's that we want in the output.
```
column_list = ['ct_exchCd','c_isin']
data = etd.get_by_isin(isin='ISIN', columnList= column_list)
```
In the above code, data will have two columns 'ct_exchCd','c_isin'



## Output Column Prefix and its description
The output dataframe has some column with prefix. Below is the description of the prefix

Prefix | Description
--- | --- 
ult_under 	| It means Ultimate Underlier. For OOF (Option on Future) Contracts, this will be the underlier of the future contract. For other contracts, these represent the actual underlier.
immed_under | It means immediate underlier. For OOF (Option on Future) Contracts, this will be option underlier i.e future contract. For other contracts, it will be null


## Output Column and its description
The output of above method is a pandas dataframe. Below is the list of column names and its description.

# Equity Data

To get data from the API, simply import the library and call the object with your API key. Next, get ready for some high quality reference data. 
You may get a key from https://rduaccess.smartstreamrdu.com/
```python
from dataAccess.EquityApi import EquityApi
equity = EquityApi(key="<<your key>>")

```
There are various api's through which data can be fetch
* Fetch By Isin
* Fetch By Isin and exchange code


Example of fetch by isin.
Replace the isin with the isin for which data needs to be fetched
```
data = equity.get_by_isin(isin='ISIN')
```

Example of fetch by isin and exchangeCode.
Replace the isin and exchange code with the isin and exchange code for which data needs to be fetched
```
data = equity.get_by_isin(isin, exchange)
```
