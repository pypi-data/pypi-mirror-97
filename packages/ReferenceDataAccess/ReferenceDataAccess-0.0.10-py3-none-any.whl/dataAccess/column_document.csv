Contracts from that same ETD product that initially are listed with a larger unit of time between them, but contain the same expiration date policy, are assumed to flow into that smallest unit of time and therefore, bear the same Listing Cycle Type as of their first listing date.

For example, Options on Comex Gold futures at CMEG (OG) shall be listed for trading in each of the nearest twenty (20) consecutive futures contract months. In addition, June and December will be listed for 72 months from the current listed month.
