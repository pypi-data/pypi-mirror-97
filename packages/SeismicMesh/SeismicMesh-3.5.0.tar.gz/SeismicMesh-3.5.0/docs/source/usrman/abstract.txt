.. topic:: Abstract

   This document describes the *SeismicMesh* package. This work aims to
   create end-to-end workflows to build quality models suitable
   for Finite Element numerical wave propagators.

   The package uses Python to wrap computationally intensive operations in C++ and has
   support for distributed memory parallelism.
