# CHANGELOG #

## Version 2.1.3, 2021-03-05 ##

- Add a few abbreviations.
- Improve tokenization of protocol-less URLs.
- Improve tokenization of a few emoticons and symbols/dingbats.
- Improve tokenization of gendered nouns (gender star, gender colon).
- Improve tokenization of simple arithmetic operations.

## Version 2.1.2, 2021-01-29 ##

- Allow hyphens in hashtags. While hyphens cannot be part of Twitter
  hashtags, we do not want to split compounds like
  “#Refugeeswelcome-Bewegung”.

## Version 2.1.1, 2020-06-30 ##

- Detection of quotes delimited by apostrophes ('…') is more
  conservative, now (issue #16).

## Version 2.1.0, 2020-06-17 ##

- New feature: Delimit sentences with XML tags (via the command line
  option --sentence-tag TAGNAME or by passing xml_sentences="TAGNAME"
  to the constructor). When using this option with XML input, SoMaJo
  tries hard to produce well-formed XML as output. To achieve this,
  some tags will need to be closed and re-opened at sentence
  boundaries. In this paragraph, for example, the italic region
  contains a sentence boundary:
  <p>Hi <i>there! How</i> are you?</p>
  SoMaJo will close the i tag before the end of the sentence and
  re-open it afterwards:
  <p> <s> Hi <i> there ! </i> </s> <s> <i> How </i> are you ? </s> </p>

## Version 2.0.6, 2020-06-12 ##

- Support all textual smileys and textfaces from Signal messenger.
- Raise a TypeError if tokenize_text is called with a string instead
  of an iterable of strings (issue #13)

## Version 2.0.5, 2020-04-09 ##

- Add heuristics for ambiguous quotation marks (issue #11).
- Avoid false positives for emoticons that contain a space (issue #12).
- Correctly tokenize obfuscated email addresses that contain spaces.
- Do not split tl;dr and its German variant zl;ng.

## Version 2.0.4, 2020-03-05 ##

- Bugfix: Prevent race conditions between tokenizer and sentence
  splitter in parallel processing (--parallel > 1).

## Version 2.0.3, 2020-02-27 ##

- Skip tests for unimplemented features (some builds will fail if any
  of the unit tests fail).

## Version 2.0.2, 2020-02-27 ##

- Bugfix: Parallel tokenization (--parallel > 1) works again.
- Support for musical notes (sharps).

## Version 2.0.1, 2019-12-19 ##

- Bugfix.

## Version 2.0.0, 2019-12-19 ##

### New features and improvements ###

- New API: Use new class SoMaJo instead of Tokenizer and
  SentenceSplitter. Currently, the old API is still supported but will
  issue deprecation warnings.
- Speed-up: Due to a new internal representation of the input text
  during processing (as a doubly linked list of Token objects),
  tokenization is now two to three times faster.
- Incremental and parallel processing of XML: If a sensible set of
  eos_tags is specified, the XML input will be processed incrementally
  (allowing for arbitrarily large XML input). In addition, if a
  sensible set of eos_tags is specified, processing can also be
  parallelized.
- New option --strip-tags to suppress the output of XML tags.
- Support for textual representations of emojis (:smile:,
  :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:, etc.).
- Support for textfaces (༼ʘ̚ل͜ʘ̚༽, ╚(ಠ_ಠ)=┐, etc.).

### Breaking changes ###

- Removed the tokenizer script (deprecated since version 1.5.0
  released in October 2017). Use somajo-tokenizer instead.
- Language codes contain the tokenization guideline: "de_CMC" instead
  of "de" and "en_PTB" instead of "en".

## Version 1.11.0, 2019-11-08 ##

- XML sentence splitting: Added hr tag to default sentence breaks
- Recognize Reddit links in shorthand notation
- Improved robustness of XML processing

## Version 1.10.7, 2019-11-01 ##

- Make recognition of gender star case insensitive
- Fix problem with “nasty” character as last character of text unit

## Version 1.10.6, 2019-10-02 ##

- Recognize gender star.
- Improve recognition of lists of numbers, section numbers and IPv4
  addresses

## Version 1.10.5, 2019-08-02 ##

- Correctly tokenize flags followed by a variation selector.
- Delete variation selector that occurs on its own.

## Version 1.10.4, 2019-08-01 ##

- Bugfix related to the --version option.

## Version 1.10.3, 2019-07-19 ##

- New option -v/--version to output version information.
- Explicitly specify input encoding as UTF-8.

## Version 1.10.2, 2019-07-02 ##

- The error that 1.10.1 tried to fix was not really caused by the
  version numbers of regex but by specifying our own version number in
  __init__.py where we also indirectly load required modules.

## Version 1.10.1, 2019-07-02 ##

- Use semantic versioning to specify minimal required version of
  regex. This fixes a bug where the dependency was not correctly
  installed.

## Version 1.10.0, 2019-06-28 ##

- Treat emoji sequences that render as a single grapheme as a single
  token. This includes flags and sequences containing modifiers and
  zero-width joiners.
- Recognize underscores used for "underlining" and split them off.
- Added a few Unicode formatting characters to the “nasty” characters.
- Replaced POSIX character classes with built-ins or Unicode
  properties.

## Version 1.9.0, 2019-04-01 ##

- New method Tokenizer.tokenize_file for easy tokenization of files
  from Python
- Added text and emoji variation selectors.
- Added new English abbreviation (Appl'n.).

## Version 1.8.3, 2018-11-02 ##

- Fixed a bug that caused abbreviations with internal dots but without
  final dot to be split up erroneously (e.g. E.ON).

## Version 1.8.2, 2018-10-26 ##

- Fixed a bug with degree measurements in English (°F, etc.).
- Fixed a bug that caused SoMaJo to hang when an XML tag occured
  within a token that is allowed to contain whitespace.

## Version 1.8.1, 2018-07-30 ##

- Fixed the following bug: When using option -e, “nasty” characters
  between whitespace within tokens that are allowed to contain
  whitespace (e.g. XML tags) caused SoMaJo to hang.
- Added zero-width no-break space (FEFF) to “nasty” characters.

## Version 1.8.0, 2018-07-04 ##

- New language: SoMaJo can tokenize English texts (using the new
  option -l/--language).
- Small improvements to tokenization (URLs, emoticons, number
  compounds, …).

## Version 1.7.0, 2018-03-22 ##

SoMaJo has now full XML support. To tokenize an XML file, use the
option -x/--xml. Via the option --tag (can be used multiple times),
you can specify which tags always constitute sentence breaks, e.g.
title, h1 or p tags in an HTML file.

## Version 1.6.0, 2018-03-05 ##

- XML declarations are recognized as single tokens.
- Additional “nasty” characters (zero-width joiners and non-joiners,
  left-to-right and right-to-left marks) are removed from the input.
- The input is normalized to Unicode normal form C (NFC).

## Version 1.5.0, 2017-10-23 ##

- Bugfix: Removed trailing space from last token in
  paragraph/sentence.
- SoMaJo should be run as 'somajo-tokenizer'. The 'tokenizer' command
  is deprecated.
- XML entities (&amp;, &#75;, &#x7f;) are recognized as single tokens.
- Some abbreviations (usw., usf., etc., uvam.) indicate sentence
  boundaries if they are followed by a potential sentence start.
- We also print a log message that indicates tokenization speed.

## Version 1.4.4, 2017-08-03 ##

This release improves sentence splitting for sentences ending in
German closing quotation marks (“).

## Version 1.4.3, 2017-08-02 ##

This is a bugfix release that fixes a bug that occured in 1.4.2 when
using the option -e on some inputs containing control characters and
other “nasty” characters.

## Version 1.4.2, 2017-07-31 ##

Control characters and other “nasty” characters (soft hyphens and
zero-width spaces) are removed from the input.

## Version 1.4.1, 2017-07-28 ##

Added support for Unicode emoticons and various other Unicode symbols.

## Version 1.4.0, 2017-07-13 ##

SoMaJo can now perform sentence splitting (using the new option
--split_sentences).

## Version 1.3.1, 2017-07-04 ##

SoMaJo is now hosted on Github and the changes made in this version
reflect that change.

## Version 1.3.0, 2016-09-02 ##

Matching of items containing “+” or “&” or being written in camel case
has been optimized a bit. Now the tokenizer runs roughly three to four
times faster.

## Version 1.2.0, 2016-09-01 ##

Two new options added: With -s/--paragraph_separator, you can specify
how paragraphs are delimited in the input data, i.e. by empty lines or
by single newlines. The --parallelization option makes it possible to
use a pool of worker processes to speed up tokenization.

## Version 1.1.2, 2016-08-25 ##

The example in the documentation is now self-contained: Sample input
has been added and the output will be printed.

## Version 1.1.1, 2016-08-19 ##

The link in the Evaluation section of the Readme now points to the
complete gold standard data.

## Version 1.1.0, 2016-08-19 ##

SoMaJo can now output additional information about the original
spelling of the tokens, i.e. if a token was followed by whitespace or
if a token contained internal whitespace (according to the
tokenization guidelines, things like “: )” get normalized to “:)”). To
use this feature, provide the tokenizer script with the -e option.

## Version 1.0.3, 2016-08-18 ##

This version works around a bug in the regex module that caused
exponential runtimes on certain inputs.
