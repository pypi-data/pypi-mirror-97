# Driver level key simulation.
## Implementation based on CTypes.
# 驱动级按键模拟。
## 基于ctypes实现。

[案例【example】](https://github.com/bode135/VirtualKey_with_Ctypes/blob/master/example.py)

> Compared to the [`Pydamo`](https://github.com/bode135/pydamo "jump to the pydamo project") scheme(I don't know how to do this with ctypes), the CTypes scheme does not support background emulation, but supports 64-bit Python.

> ctypes方案对比[`pydamo`](https://github.com/bode135/pydamo "jump to the pydamo project")方案(我不知道怎么用ctypes做后台)，不支持后台模拟，但支持64位python。
