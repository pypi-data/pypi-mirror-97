# aanalytics2

The aanalytics2 python library stands for Adobe Analytics API 2.0 support.
It is set to wrap the different endpoints from the documentation.
You can find the swagger documentation [here](https://adobedocs.github.io/analytics-2.0-apis/).

The different section will quickly explain the methods available in the differennt part of this API.

## Core components

The methods available directly from the module are the following:

### createConfigFile

This methods allows you to create JSON file that will host the different information required for your connection to Adobe IO and to retrieve the token.
It usually is like this.

```python
import aanalytics2 as api2
api2.createConfigFile()
```

As you can see, it takes no argument and the output of the file will look like this :

```javaScript
{
    'org_id': '<orgID>',
    'api_key': "<APIkey>",
    'tech_id': "<something>@techacct.adobe.com",
    'secret': "<YourSecret>",
    'pathToKey': '<path/to/your/privatekey.key>',
}
```

You update the information from the Adobe IO account that you have setup.

### importConfigFile

As you have created your JSON config file, you will need to import it before realizing any request to the Analytics API.
The method takes the file name as an argument, or the path where your file exist.

```python
import aanalytics2 as api2
api2.importConfigFile('config.json')
```

or

```python
import aanalytics2 as api2
myfilePath = './myCredential/config.json'
api2.importConfigFile(myfilePath)
```

### retrieveToken (OPTIONAL)

This method is not mandatory because each of your requests will be taken care by a wrapping function that will generate a token if you don't have one.
However, at some point, you may want to generate a token for a reason X or Y, so this function is available for that use-case.
This function takes no argument as long as you have imported the config file.
It returns the token.

```python
import aanalytics2 as api2
api2.importConfigFile('config.json')

token = api2.retrieveToken()
```

This method also caches the time limit of the token usage in the config_object in config module.
It can be accessed like this:

```python
aanalytics2.config.config_object
## your token
aanalytics2.config.config_object['token']
```

You can review when this token expire through the time module:

```python
import time
time.ctime(aanalytics2.config.config_object['date_limit'])

## returns something like : 'Mon May 17 18:08:42 2023'
```

## Login class

The `Login` class is the capability to get the different Login Company ID to create your conneciton later on.\
The class can be instanciated **after** you have imported the configuration JSON file.

```python
import aanalytics2 as api2
api2.importConfigFile('myconfig.json')
## Here instanciating the Login class
login = api2.Login()

## Here retrieving the cids
cids = login.getCompanyId()
```

From this implementation, you can then retrieve the list of loginCompanyId from your __cids__ variable or the **__COMPANY_IDS__** attributes.

```python
## login company Id is kept in that attribute after the usage of the getCompanyId()
login.COMPANY_IDS

## returns (example):
[
 {'globalCompanyId': 'comp1',
  'companyName': 'Company1',
  'apiRateLimitPolicy': 'aa_api_tier10_tp',
  'dpc': 'lon'},
 {'globalCompanyId': 'comp2',
  'companyName': 'Company2',
  'apiRateLimitPolicy': 'aa_api_tier10_tp',
  'dpc': 'lon'}
]

```

After selecting your `globalCompanyId`, you can generate your connection to the Login company by calling the **__createAnalyticsConnection__**.

```python
mycompany1 = loggin.createAnalyticsConnection('comp1')
```

We will see later that you can also directly use the `Analytics` class.

### Retry Parameter

The latest version of the aanalytics2 module also provides a **retry** parameter.\
This parameter will be used to resend the query in case an error occurs in the response.\
Several reason an error can occur:

* connectivity issue
* server issue from Adobe Analytics API
* inconsistent behavior from Adobe Analytics API

The retry parameter is going to be attached to every GET method available in your `Analytics` class.\
**Note**
The `getReport` is in fact a POST method. \
From my point of view, you want to get data so I called it that way. \
From Adobe API you are generating a report, therefore it requires a POST method with data attached (your report config).\
Consequently, the `getReport` method doesn't support the **retry** parameter at the moment.\
This is also a design decision because it is based on data you are providing. If the data is corrupted or non-conformed, I do not realize a check but I expect Adobe Analytics API to return an error.\
Following this error, I do not want to __retry__ sending that data again.

You can instantiate the `Analytics` class and the `Login` class with the **retry** parameter.\
The parameter takes the number of time you would like to retry in case of error.\
If you create the `Analytics` class from the `Login` instance, the retry parameter value is passed (except if you override it).

## Analytics class

Adobe Analytics API 2.0 requires you to send the companyID you have selected in the header of each request you do in that company.
There used to be a method in this API to update the header accordingly.
I changed this logic to create a class that encapsulate this choice directly.
Therefore it is possible to use 2 instances of the class at the same time and therefore 2 companyID can be used almost at the same time.

As seen in the previous example, you instantiate the class by passing the companyID.

```python
import aanalytics2 as api2
#...
mycompany = api2.Analytics(cid)

## or with retry parameter
mycompany = api2.Analytics(cid,retry=2)
```

You instance will have all of the Analytics endpoint wrapped.
At any point in time, you can use the docstring that have been set in this module by using the help function.

```python
help(mycompany.getSegments)
## returns:
##getSegments(name: str = None, tagNames: str = None, inclType: str = 'all', rsids_list: list = None, sidFilter: list = None, extended_info: bool = False, format: str = 'df', save: bool = False, verbose: bool = False, **kwargs) -> object method of aanalytics2.Analytics instance
#    Retrieve the list of segments. Returns a data frame.
#    Arguments:
#        name : OPTIONAL : Filter to only include segments that contains the name (str)
#        tagNames : OPTIONAL : Filter list to only include segments that contains one of the tags (string delimited with comma, can be list as well)
#...
```

One of the specific functionality for this class, is that you can update the token with a new one by using the _refreshToken_ method.
It takes one argument (the token string) and requires you to run the retrieveToken method beforehand.

```python
import aanalytics2 as api2
#...
token = api2.retrieveToken()
mycompany.refreshToken(token)

```

With all of my API wrappers, I ususall separate the methody by the GET (fetching information), the CREATE methods (posting information), the DELETE methods, the UPDATE mehthods.
This API is no exception.

## The Project class

There is a way to retrieve projects and especially project definition.\
The information returns is a dictionary (JSON) that may not be easy to decipher for analysts.\
Therefore, I have created a class that can ease the understanding of the data in the project dictionary.\
The instance of that class will provide some information directly from class attributes.

The different attributes are:

* "id" of the project
* "name" of the project
* "description" of the project
* "rsid" attached to the project (can be a Virtual Report Suite ID)
* "ownerName" of the project owner
* "ownerId" of the project owner
* "ownerEmail" of the project owner
* "template" is a boolean if the project is a template or not
* "curation" is a boolean if the project has been curated or not
* "version" of the project
* "nbPanels" gives the number of Panels there is in your projects
* "nbSubPanels" gives the number of subPanels that exist in your project
* "nbElementsUsed" gives you how many different dimensions, metrics, segments and calcuated are being used in your projects. Elements have been deduplicated.
* "elementsUsed" is a dictionary to gives you the different elements used such as:
  * rsids
  * dimensions
  * metrics
  * segments
  * calculatedMetrics

A method "to_dict()" also exists on this instance so you can flatten these information and later use them in a pandas dataframe if you wish.

#### BETA Methods

I have implemented a `getProjects`, `getProject`, `updateProject` and `createProject` methods.
These methods are not officially available in the documentation of Adobe API 2.0.
Therefore, if they do stop working, this may not come from the API wrapper / SDK aanalytics2.
Please refer to the docstring for these methods for now.

From these beta methods, I have created other supported methods that are explained in the [Project documentation](./projects.md).

### Create

The Adobe Analytics API 2.0 provides some endpoint to create elements in your Analytics setup.

### Get report

The get report from Adobe Analytics, I will recommend you to watch the [video](https://youtu.be/j1kI3peSXhY) that explains how you can generate the JSON file for requesting the report through API.
This getReport methods is a bit special because it is mostly what users would have liked to have from this API, so it is a separate part.

First of all, you need to understand that this API is a replicate of Adobe Analytics Workspace interface.
There is no additional feautres or way to bypass the limitation of Analytics Workspace from this API.
It means that the (low traffic) will still appear and also the filters are different requests.
Also, there is a limit of 120 requests per minute, and a limit threshold of 12 requests for 6 seconds.
Therefore, requesting large amount of data is not the use-case for the API 2.0.

When you have generated your request through the UI interface you can directly saved it in a json file.
You can then either directly use it with the aanalytics2 module or rework it in python.

Before going with examples, I will explain the method and its arguments:

* getReport : Retrieve data from a JSON request.Returns an object containing meta info and dataframe.
  Arguments:
  * json_request: REQUIRED : JSON statement that contains your request for Analytics API 2.0.
  The argument can be :
    * a dictionary : It will be used as it is.
    * a string that is a dictionary : It will be transformed to a dictionary / JSON.
    * a path to a JSON file that contains the statement (must end with ".json").
  * n_result : OPTIONAL : Number of result that you would like to retrieve. (default 1000)
    if you want to have all possible data, use "inf".
  * item_id : OPTIONAL : Boolean to define if you want to return the item id for sub requests (default False)
  * save : OPTIONAL : If you would like to save the data within a CSV file. (default False)
  * verbose : OPTIONAL : If you want to have comment display (default False)

As you can see, you can use the getReport with different variable types (string, path or dictionary).

The object that is being returned is hosting the information about your request. In case you need to have the context during your usage of the data.
Example of the object being returned :

```python
{'dimension': 'variables/eVarX',
    'filters': {'globalFilters': ['2019-11-01T00:00:00.000/2019-12-01T00:00:00.000'],
    'metricsFilters': {}},##if any filters have been applied.
    'rsid': 'my.rsid',
    'metrics': ['metrics/visits'],
    'data': #pandas DataFrame.
}
```

As you can see it returns the actual data of your request in the "data" key, as a dataframe.
Therefore, you can use the data by doing the extraction of the data.
Example:

```python
myreport = mycompany.getReport('myReport.json')
mydata = myreport['data']
```

**Note** : It can be that some data are not returned by the API (unknown reason for me). The exception is then handle by setting "missing_value" to these items.\
Because a dictionary is being built before returning the dataframe, it means that all missing value will be set as "missing_value" and only the last key will remain.

**Handling Throttle** : The throttle limit of 12 requests per 6 seconds or 120 requests per minute is handle automatically. It automatically pause the requests for 50 seconds when the limit is reached.

### The create methods

Adobe Analytics API 2.0 currently, limiting number of creation.
You can only create Calculated Metrics and Segments so far.

* createSegment:
  Arguments:
  * segmentJSON : REQUIRED : the dictionary that represents the JSON statement for the segment.

* createCalculatedMetrics:
  Arguments:
  * metricJSON : REQUIRED : the dictionary that represents the JSON statement for the  Calculated Metrics.
    Required in the dictionary :  name, definition, rsid
