        Basic IOT over BLE advertisements.
        
        
        Dependencies
        =============
        This driver depends on:
        
        * `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_
        
        Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
        This is easily achieved by downloading
        `the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://circuitpython.org/libraries>`_.
        
        Installing from PyPI
        =====================
        .. note:: Only the bridge examples work on Raspberry Pi because Blinka `_bleio` doesn't support
            advertising, only scanning.
        
        On supported GNU/Linux systems like the Raspberry Pi, you can install the driver locally `from
        PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/adafruit-circuitpython-ble_broadcastnet/>`_. To install for current user:
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-ble-broadcastnet
        
        To install system-wide (this may be required in some cases):
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-ble-broadcastnet
        
        To install in a virtual environment in your current project:
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            mkdir project-name && cd project-name
            python3 -m venv .env
            source .env/bin/activate
            pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-ble-broadcastnet
        
        Usage Example
        =============
        
        Add a secrets.py file and then run ``ble_broadcastnet_blinka_bridge.py``.
