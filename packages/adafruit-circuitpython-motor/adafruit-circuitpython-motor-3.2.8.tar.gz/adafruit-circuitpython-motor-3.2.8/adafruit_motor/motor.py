====================================================

Simple control of a DC motor. DC motors have two wires and should not be connected directly to
the PWM connections. Instead use intermediate circuitry to control a much stronger power source with
the PWM. The `Adafruit Stepper + DC Motor FeatherWing <https://www.adafruit.com/product/2927>`_,
`Adafruit TB6612 1.2A DC/Stepper Motor Driver Breakout Board
<https://www.adafruit.com/product/2448>`_ and `Adafruit Motor/Stepper/Servo Shield for Arduino v2
Kit - v2.3 <https://www.adafruit.com/product/1438>`_ do this for popular form
factors already.

.. note:: The TB6612 boards feature three inputs XIN1, XIN2 and PWMX. Since we PWM the INs directly
  its expected that the PWM pin is consistently high.
