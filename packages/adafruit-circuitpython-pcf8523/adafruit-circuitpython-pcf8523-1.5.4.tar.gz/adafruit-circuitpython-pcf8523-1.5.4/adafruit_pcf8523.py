`adafruit_pcf8523` - PCF8523 Real Time Clock module
====================================================

This library supports the use of the PCF8523-based RTC in CircuitPython. It
contains a base RTC class used by all Adafruit RTC libraries. This base
class is inherited by the chip-specific subclasses.

Functions are included for reading and writing registers and manipulating
datetime objects.

Author(s): Philip R. Moyer and Radomir Dopieralski for Adafruit Industries.
Date: November 2016
Affiliation: Adafruit Industries

Implementation Notes
--------------------

**Hardware:**

* Adafruit `Adalogger FeatherWing - RTC + SD Add-on <https://www.adafruit.com/products/2922>`_
  (Product ID: 2922)
* Adafruit `PCF8523 RTC breakout <https://www.adafruit.com/products/3295>`_ (Product ID: 3295)

**Software and Dependencies:**

* Adafruit CircuitPython firmware: https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases
