LoRaWAN/The Things Network, for CircuitPython.

Dependencies
=============
This driver depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_
* `Bus Device <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BusDevice>`_

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading `the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle>`_.

Installing from PyPI
====================

On supported GNU/Linux systems like the Raspberry Pi, you can install the driver locally `from
PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/adafruit-circuitpython-tinylora/>`_. To install for current user:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-tinylora

To install system-wide (this may be required in some cases):

.. code-block:: shell

    sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-tinylora

To install in a virtual environment in your current project:

.. code-block:: shell

    mkdir project-name && cd project-name
    python3 -m venv .env
    source .env/bin/activate
    pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-tinylora

Usage Example
=============

Usage is described in the `learn guide for this library <https://learn.adafruit.com/using-lorawan-and-the-things-network-with-circuitpython>`_.

This library was written by ClemensRiederer. We've converted it to work with Adafruit CircuitPython and made
changes so it works with the Raspberry Pi and Adafruit Feather M0/M4. We've added examples for using this library
to transmit data and sensor data to The Things Network.
