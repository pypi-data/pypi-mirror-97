    States are given by a single `np.ndarray` of shape `(10, )`. The first 9 elements
    denote the game board in row-major order (board is of shape `(3, 3)`). Each board
    element is in `{-1, 0, 1}`, where `-1` and `1` denote occupied cells and `0` empty
    cells. The last element in the state vector (i.e. element index 9) is either `+1`
    or `-1`, denoting the player who is about to play.

    Actions discrete in `{0, 1, ..., 8}`, denoting, in row-major order, which cell to
    place the next marker in.

    Rewards are given at the end of a game round, i.e. intermediate rewards are zero.
