In the perpendicular experimental arrangement (shown here), the polarization vector $\mathaccentV {vec}17EE \propto \mathaccentV {hat}05Ez$ of the optical pump pulse is perpendicular to the incident wave vector $\mathaccentV {vec}17Ek_0 \equiv k \mathaccentV {hat}05Ey$ of the X-ray probe pulse. The incident X-ray photons scatter at angle $\theta $ with respect to $\mathaccentV {vec}17Ek_0$, and azimuthal angle $\eta $ with respect to $\mathaccentV {vec}17EE$. These two angles fully describe the scattering in the elastic regime, as $|\mathaccentV {vec}17Ek_0|$ = $|\mathaccentV {vec}17Ek_s|$. The scattering vector $\mathaccentV {vec}17Eq$ is the difference between the incident and scattered wave vectors $\mathaccentV {vec}17Eq \equiv \mathaccentV {vec}17Ek_0 - \mathaccentV {vec}17Ek_s$. The amplitude of the scattering vector is $q \equiv |\mathaccentV {vec}17Eq| = 2 k \qopname  \relax o{sin}\theta / 2$.
