Description: # Aleatoryous 3
        
        This is the 3rth Generation of aleatory objects, built by Diego
        Ramirez.
        
        ## Introduction
        
        The Aleatoryous package allows you to build:
        
        - Aleatory Syntax objects
          - Dice: aleatory.dice
          - Coin: aleatory.coin
          - Roulette: aleatory.roulette
        
        By using the [Python](http://python.org) library [random](http://docs.python.org/3.8/library/random), Aleatoryous object can build many solutions
        for problems where aleatory numbers or specific output are needed.
        
        This package is built to be used with Python versions 3.5 to 3.9.
        
        To enjoy the Aleatoryous materials, you must download the package from the [PyPi](http://pypi.org/project/aleat3#files)
        and install it with pip by one of this ways:
        
        ```
        pip install aleat3_[version]_[platform].whl
        
        pip install aleat3_[version]_[platform].tar.gz
        
        pip install aleat3==[version]
        
        pip install --upgrade aleat3
        
        pip install aleat3
        ```
        
        #### The story of Aleatoryous
        
        Well, you might ask: "If this package is a 3rth generation of Aleatoryous project,
        what about generations 1 and 2?".
        
        The answer is that versions [1](http://pypi.org/project/aleat1) and [2](http://pypi.org/project/aleat2) could be called
        "deprecated versions" of final package. Even when this versions where released after version [3](http://pypi.org/project/aleat3),
        they are incomplete or not functional.
        
        So, don't worry: you are handling the best version of Aleatoryous.

        To call this functions, import the example and just `run()` it:
        
        ```python
        from aleat3.applications import rouletteWinners  # As an example
        rouletteWinners.run()
        ```

        #### What's new in aleat3 0.0.5
        
        - Some variables deleted or recycled:
          - Private variables recycled
        
        #### What's new in aleat3 0.0.4
        
        - Minor bugs resolved:
          - Cleaner output
          - Faster operations
        - Some variables deleted or recycled:
          - Variable `Aleatoryous.cache` deleted
          - Variable `Aleatoryous.it` deleted
          - Private variables recycled
        
        #### What's new in aleat3 0.0.3
        
        At version 0.0.2, you could change the Aleatoryous mode by typing:
        
        ```python
        obj = Aleatoryous("aleatory.coin")
        
        obj.mode = "Dice"
        ```
        
        But now, **that operation is forbidden**, and the system might return a message
        like this:
        
        ```
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        File .../-.py in <module>
            obj.mode = "Dice"
                ^
        AttributeError: object "Aleatoryous" has no attribute "mode"
        ```
        
        Instead of that, **use the new method _Aleatoryous.changemode()_**:
        
        ```python
        obj.changemode("aleatory.dice")
        ```
        
        Also, in version 0.0.3, you can get the mode name of your object:
        
        ```python
        print(obj.getmode())
        ```
        
        ## Building Aleatory Objects
        
        To import the aleat3 library, type:
        
        ```python
        from aleat3 import *  # Call the whole aleat3 library
        ```
        
        After aleat3 library is imported, type:
        
        ```python
        obj = Aleatoryous()   # Build an aleatory coin by default
        ```
        
        All 3 objects are built at the same way in Python. No matter the mode, you can
        get aleatory output with methods:
        
        ```python
        # Return: strings or integers
        obj.single()         # Only one iteration
        # Return: lists
        obj.first_5()        # First 5 results
        obj.first_10()       # First 10
        obj.first_50()       # First 50
        obj.first_100()      # First 100
        obj.first_given(3)   # Iterate all the given times
        ```
        
        Now, we give you a description of the items:
        
        ### *aleatory.coin*
        
        The most simple mode of Aleatoryous. It can be called by 2 ways:
        
        - Just typing `obj = Aleatoryous()`. The default "mode" is *aleatory.coin*.
        - Being more specific, typing `obj = Aleatoryous("aleatory.coin")`.
        
        The *aleatory.coin* can return 2 different results:
        
        - String "Head"
        - String "Tails"
        
        ###### Using *CoinToBinary* function
        
        If you want, you can convert the *string* output from *aleatory.coin* to *int*
        output with the function `aleat3.coinToBinary` included in the " * " import.
        
        Follow the example:
        
        ```python
        from aleat3 import *
        obj = Aleatoryous("aleatory.coin")
        
        result = obj.single()  # return only 1 value
        print(coinToBinary(result))
        ```
        
        ###### Using *CoinToBool* function
        
        Just like _coinToBinary_, the function _coinToBool_ can make conversions from
        _aleatory.dice_ output, but returns a boolean constant (True/False).
        
        Following the example from _coinToBinary_:
        
        ```python
        print(coinToBool(result))
        ```
        
        
        ### *aleatory.dice*
        
        The second mode of Aleatoryous returns a range **between 1 and 6**, just like
        traditional dices. If you want an *aleatory.dice*, type:
        
        ```python
        obj = Aleatoryous("aleatory.dice")
        ```
        
        And, like traditional dices, **you could use more than one to get a larger result:**
        
        ```python
        dice1 = Aleatoryous("aleatory.dice")
        dice2 = Aleatoryous("aleatory.dice")
        
        res = dice1.single() + dice2.single() # returns a range between 2 and 12
        print(res)
        ```
        
        ### *aleatory.roulette*
        
        The third and the most complex mode of Aleatoryous.
        __This is the only mode that takes both parameters__ of Aleatoryous object:
        
        ```
        Aleatoryous(mode, extras)
        ```
        
        The **mode** parameter is taken by all the 3 modes. But the **extras** is only made
        for *aleatory.roulette*. There you put a list of possible results. The list can have
        any Python data structure, it will be iterated.
        
        Follow the example:
        
        ```python
        # Put your options here
        lst = ["Option 1",
               {"Sub Option 1": 2, "Sub Option 2": None},
               10.9,
               [3, 4, 1],
               None]
        
        # Build the object
        obj = Aleatoryous("aleatory.roulette", lst) # The 2nd parameter is taken
        print(obj.single())
        ```
        
        #### Debugging *aleatory.roulette* errors
        
        Remember, **you can only include lists in the "mode" parameter.** For example,
        if you type:
        
        ```python
        obj = Aleatoryous("aleatory.roulette", {"Option 1": 1, "Option 2": 2}) # A dictionary
        ```
        
        You'll receive a message like this:
        
        ```
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        File .../-.py in <module>
            obj = Aleatoryous("aleatory.roulette", {"Option 1": 1, "Option 2": 2})
                                                    ^
        File .../aleat3/constructor.py in __init__
            raise ...
        aleat3.constructor.InitError: __init__() Invalid Syntax (Unexpected parameter given: extras)
        ```
        
        ## Making solutions with Aleatoryous - Some examples
        
        There are several ways to applicate the aleat3 features, from math education to
        game development, you can use the Aleatoryous object and other functions included
        by many, many ways. We are giving some examples:
        
        #### Iterating with _aleatory.roulette_
        
        The most used mode is *aleatory.roulette*, because you can control data to be
        iterated in aleatory selection.
        
        For example, if you read a file and want to get a random line:
        
        ```python
        # The file register.txt will contain many-many-many names. We want 5 aleatory
        # winners:
        
        # John
        # Richard
        # Tamara
        # Axel
        # Gael
        # Sarah
        # Chuck
        
        f = open("C://Users/Admin/Documents/register.txt", "r")
        l = []
        
        for i in f:
          l.append(i.rstrip())
        
        # Operate the file data
        from aleat3 import *
        
        r = Aleatoryous("aleatory.roulette", l)
        res = r.first_given(5, repeat=False)      # New since version 0.0.6: no-repetition
        print(res)
        ```
        
        And we'll get an output like:
        
        ```
        ["Richard", "Gael", "John", "Tamara", "Sarah"]
        ```
        
        #### Binary aleatory numbers with _aleatory.coin + coinToBinary_
        
        As we said before, the *coinToBinary* function converts an *aleatory.coin* output
        to pseudo-binary numbers (1 or 0). We can use this function when you need an aleatory
        output between 1 and 0. View the _Using coinToBinary function_ process shown above.
        
        #### Building games with _aleatory.dice_
        
        You could use the *aleatory.dice* natural properties for building complex games
        where a dice is required.
        
        For example, you can use the [tkinter](http://docs.python.org/3.8/library/tkinter) module for building
        graphical interfaces, and then use the *aleatory.dice* to create a game where
        the user can use a dice.
        
        ## Module tests
        
        Since version 0.1.1, some aleat3 folder files have a new function: `module_test()`.
        
        Only this files are available for testing:
        
        - aleat3/constructor.py
        - aleat3/output/colored.py
        - aleat3/output/init_errors.py
        
        (Other files are private or `__init__` scripts).
        
        To use the `module_test()`, type:
        
        ```python
        from aleat3.constructor import module_test # Using constructor.py as an example
        module_test()
        ```
        
        Then, you'll receive an output like:
        
        ```
        ----Module test: constructor.py----
        
        Testing module...
        
        Testing objects...
        -Testing object 'aleat3.Aleatoryous'...
         The object 'aleat3.Aleatoryous' is OK.
        
        (...)
        
        The module is OK.
        
        ----Test finished----
        
        Done
        ```
        
        Also, when using the file as `__main__` level:
        
        ```
        NOTE: When using the file as __main__ level, you are executing the module test.
        This operation may take some minutes.
        
        ----Module test: constructor.py----
        
        Testing module...
        
        Testing objects...
        -Testing object 'aleat3.Aleatoryous'...
         The object 'aleat3.Aleatoryous' is OK.
        
        (...)
        
        The module is OK.
        
        ----Test finished----
        
        Done
        ```
        
        __NOTE:__ These tests are based in common use of each function or object in file.
        If you run the test, tells you the module is OK, and your package still failing,
        please send an e-mail [here](mailto:dr01191115@gmail.com).
        
        
        ## aleat3 scripts
        
        Since 0.2.0, aleat3 setup added some *console_scripts*, who work like short "demos"
        about the power of aleat3:
        
        ```
