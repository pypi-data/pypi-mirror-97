Description: # Anime Character API
        
        This is an unofficial API to extract an anime character data from [myanimelist](https://myanimelist.net/).
        
        Currently, the API is very basic, but I will be adding a lot of stuff to easily extract data.
        
        If you wish to see a feature, please raise an issue. We will surely work on it.
        
        ## Installation and Usage
        
        To install the library:
        ```python
        pip install animec
        ```
        
        To import the library:
        ```python
        import animec
        # OR
        from animec import *
        ```
        
        ## Example 
        
        ### Obtaining the character's image url
        
        ```python
        from animec import *
        
        our_object = Character("okabe rintarou")
        result = our_object.search()
        
        title = result["title"]
        image_url = result["image"]
        link = result["url"]
        
        print(f"Title: {title} \nImage Url: {image_url} \nLink: {link}")
        ```
