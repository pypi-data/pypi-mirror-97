    The mountainlab format is a raw binary file with a simple header. If the
    file contains more than one channel, the layout must be T x N, where N is
    the number of channels and T is the number of samples. Note that the
    official documentation has this backwards, perhaps because they're coming
    from MATLAB (i.e. Fortran) world.

    The returned object may be used as a context manager, and will close the
    underlying file when the context exits. Data can be appended to files opened
    for writing as long as the number of channels and data type remain the same.

    file:          the path of the file to open
    mode:          the mode to open the file ('r' or 'w')
    sampling_rate: specify the sampling rate of the data. this has no effect on the file.
