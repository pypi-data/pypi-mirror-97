==========

Conduct principled inference of stellar population properties from photometric
and/or spectroscopic data.  Prospector allows you to:

* Infer high-dimensional stellar population properties using parameteric or nonparametric SFHs
  (with nested or ensemble MCMC sampling)

* Combine photometric and spectroscopic data from the UV to IR rigorously using a flexible
  spectroscopic calibration model.

* Forward model many aspects of spectroscopic data analysis and
  calibration, including spectrophotometric calibration and wavelength solution,
  thus properly incorporating uncertainties in these components in the final  parameter uncertainties.

Installation
------
```
cd <install_dir>
git clone https://github.com/bd-j/prospector
cd prospector
python setup.py install
```

Then in Python
```python
import prospect
```

Prospector is pure python.
See [installation](doc/installation.rst) for requirements.
Other files in the [doc/](doc/) directory explain the usage of the code,
and you can read the documentation [here](http://prospect.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

See also the [tutorial](demo/tutorial.rst)
or the [interactive demo](demo/InteractiveDemo.ipynb)
for fitting photometric data with composite stellar populations.


Example
-------
Inference with mock broadband data, showing the change in posteriors as the
number of photometric bands is increased.
