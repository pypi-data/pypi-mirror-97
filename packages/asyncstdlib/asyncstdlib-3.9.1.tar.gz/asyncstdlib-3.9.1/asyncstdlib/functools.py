    Transform a method into an attribute whose value is cached

    When applied to an asynchronous method of a class, instances have an attribute
    of the same name as the method (similar to :py:class:`property`). Using this
    attribute with ``await`` provides the value of using the method with ``await``.

    The attribute value is cached on the instance after being computed;
    subsequent uses of the attribute with ``await`` provide the cached value,
    without executing the method again.
    The cached value can be cleared using ``del``, in which case the next
    access will recompute the value using the wrapped method.
