   async neutral
      An object that may provide either of a regular or asynchronous implementation.
      For example, an async neutral iterable may support either regular
      ``for _ in iterable`` or asynchronous ``async for _ in iterable`` iteration.

   borrowing
   borrowed object
      Many ``async`` objects need to be cleaned up explicitly â€“ for example,
      an :term:`asynchronous iterator` should generally be ``aclose``\ d after use
      (see `PEP 533`_ for details). When *borrowing* such an object to a temporary
      owner, the original owner guarantees to clean up the object but prevents the
      temporary owner from doing so.
