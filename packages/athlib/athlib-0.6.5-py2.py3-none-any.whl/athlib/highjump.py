"""High Jump and Pole Vault calculator.

This module provides an object to simulate a high jump or pole vault
competition, and to work out the scores.

We can present and extract data in this format, which is normally
how field cards are written.

#The countback rule used to separate competitors with equal best heights in High Jump and Pole Vault is possibly the most misunderstood rule in the whole of the sport. Here's how it operates:
#The athlete with the fewest attempts at the last height successfully cleared gets the verdict.
#This means that, no matter how poorly your earlier attempts have gone, there's still a way back into the competition.
#Then you count the athletes's number of failures, not including any attempts beyond the height actually cleared: the athlete with the fewest gets the verdict.
#So you cannot harm your cause by trying for a height which you think it unlikely that you will clear. But accurate jumping at the lower heights is vital!
