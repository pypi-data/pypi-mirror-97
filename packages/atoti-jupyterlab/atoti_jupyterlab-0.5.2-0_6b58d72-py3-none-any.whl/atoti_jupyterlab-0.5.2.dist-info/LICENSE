    38. Non - waiver. Unless otherwise agreed, failure by either Party
        to exercise any of its rights hereunder or to enforce any
        provision of this EULA will not be deemed a waiver or forfeiture
        of such rights or ability to enforce such provision.

    39. Severance. If any provision of this EULA (or part of any
        provision) is held to be void or otherwise unenforceable by any
        court of competent jurisdiction, such provision (or part) shall,
        to the extent necessary to ensure that the remaining provisions
        of this EULA are not void or unenforceable, be deemed to be
        deleted and the validity and/or enforceability of the remaining
        provisions of this EULA shall not be affected. In such a case,
        the Parties will do their best efforts to interpret or
        renegotiate the concerned provision to achieve as nearly as
        possible the same economic effect of the original provision and
        remain in line with the Parties’ intentions.

    40. Compliance. Upon ActiveViam’s written request, the End User will

    41. Modifications. The EULA may be modified at any time and without
        any prior notice. The applicable version of the EULA that
        governs the use of the Software is the EULA in force when End
        User downloads the Software and that is enclosed with it. Any
        modification of the EULA applies to all the elements previously
        downloaded by End User and overrides any previous version as
        soon as End User downloads any release.

    42. This EULA is exclusively governed by the laws of France. In
        order to resolve amicably any dispute that may arise with
        respect to the interpretation, the performance and/or the
        termination of this EULA, the Parties agree to meet after the
        receipt of a notice sent by registered mail by one of the
        Parties, with the intent to solve any dispute in an amicable
        way. Failing for the Parties to reach an amicable settlement by
        executing a settlement agreement within 30 (thirty) days
        following the notification by a Party of the existence of the
        dispute and making an express reference to this provision, the
        Parties shall submit their dispute to the Paris commercial court
        that will have exclusive jurisdiction to settle the dispute.
