    r"""Return the Internal Rate of Return based on the underlying cash flows and market values.

    The IRR is the rate ``r`` that nullifies the Net Present Value:

    .. math::

        NPV = \\sum_{i=0}^{T} CF_i (1 + r)^{\\frac{T - t_i}{T}} = 0

    With:

        * :math:`T` the total number of days since the beginning
        * :math:`t_i` the number of days since the beginning for date i
        * :math:`CF_i` the enhanced cashflow for date i:

            * CF of the first day is the opposite of the market value for this day: :math:`CF_0 = - MV_0`.
            * CF of the last day is increased by the market value for this day: :math:`CF_T = cash\\_flow_T + MV_T`.
            * Otherwise CF is the input cash flow: :math:`CF_i = cash\\_flow_i`.

    This equation is solved using the Newton's method.

    Example:

        With the following data:

        +------------+-------------+-------------------+
        | Date       | MarketValue | CashFlows         |

        The IRR can be defined like this::

            cube.query(m["irr"])
            >>> 0.14397

    Args:
        cash_flows: The measure representing the cash flows.
        market_value: The measure representing the market value, used to enhanced the cashflows first and last value.
            If the cash flows don't need to be enhanced then ``0`` can be used.
        date: The date hierarchy. It must have a single date level.
        precision: The precision of the IRR value.
