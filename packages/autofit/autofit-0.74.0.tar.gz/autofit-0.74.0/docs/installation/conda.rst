Installation with conda
=======================

Installation via a conda environment circumvents compatibility issues when installing certain libraries. This guide
assumes you have a working installation of `conda <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`_.

First, create a conda environment (we name is ``autofit`` to signify it is for the **PyAutoFit** install).

The command below creates this environment with some of the bigger package requirements, the rest will be installed
with **PyAutoFit** via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n autofit numpy scipy

Activate the conda environment (you will have to do this every time you want to run **PyAutoFit**):

.. code-block:: bash

    conda activate autofit

Install autofit:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install autofit

Next, clone the ``autofit workspace`` (the line ``--depth 1`` clones only the most recent branch on
the ``autofit_workspace``, reducing the download size):

.. code-block:: bash

   cd /path/on/your/computer/you/want/to/put/the/autofit_workspace
   git clone https://github.com/Jammy2211/autofit_workspace --depth 1
   cd autofit_workspace

Run the `welcome.py` script to get started!

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 welcome.py
