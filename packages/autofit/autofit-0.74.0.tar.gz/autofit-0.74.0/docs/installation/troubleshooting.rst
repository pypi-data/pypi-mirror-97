Troubleshooting
===============

Current Working Directory
-------------------------

**PyAutoFit** scripts assume that the ``autofit_workspace`` directory is the Python working directory. This means
that, when you run an example script, you should run it from the ``autofit_workspace`` as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd path/to/autofit_workspace (if you are not already in the autofit_workspace).
    python3 scripts/overview/simple/fit.py

The reasons for this are so that **PyAutoFit** can:

 - Load configuration settings from config files in the ``autofit_workspace/config`` folder.
 - Load example data from the ``autofit_workspace/dataset`` folder.
 - Output the results of models fits to your hard-disk to the ``autofit/output`` folder.
 - Import modules from the ``autofit_workspace``, for example ``from autofit_workspace.transdimensional import pipelines``.

If you have any errors relating to importing modules, loading data or outputting results it is likely because you
are not running the script with the ``autofit_workspace`` as the working directory!
