        The lens dataset is the collection of data_type (image, noise-map, PSF), a mask, grid, convolver \

        Parameters
        ----------
        grid_class : ag.Grid2D
            The type of grid used to create the image from the `Galaxy` and `Plane`. The options are `Grid2D`,
            `Grid2DIterate` and `Grid2DInterpolate` (see the `Grid2D` documentation for a description of these options).
        grid_inversion_class : ag.Grid2D
            The type of grid used to create the grid that maps the `Inversion` source pixels to the data's image-pixels.
            The options are `Grid2D`, `Grid2DIterate` and `Grid2DInterpolate` (see the `Grid2D` documentation for a
            description of these options).
        sub_size : int
            If the grid and / or grid_inversion use a `Grid2D`, this sets the sub-size used by the `Grid2D`.
        fractional_accuracy : float
            If the grid and / or grid_inversion use a `Grid2DIterate`, this sets the fractional accuracy it
            uses when evaluating functions.
        sub_steps : [int]
            If the grid and / or grid_inversion use a `Grid2DIterate`, this sets the steps the sub-size is increased by
            to meet the fractional accuracy when evaluating functions.
        pixel_scales_interp : float or (float, float)
            If the grid and / or grid_inversion use a `Grid2DInterpolate`, this sets the resolution of the interpolation
            grid.
        signal_to_noise_limit : float
            If input, the dataset's noise-map is rescaled such that no pixel has a signal-to-noise above the
            signa to noise limit.

        mask: msk.Mask2D
            The 2D mask that is applied to the image.
        sub_size : int
            The size of the sub-grid used for each lens SubGrid. E.g. a value of 2 grid each image-pixel on a 2x2 \

        psf_shape_2d : (int, int)
            The shape of the PSF used for convolving model image generated using analytic light profiles. A smaller \
            shape will trim the PSF relative to the input image PSF, giving a faster analysis run-time.
        positions : [[]]
            Lists of image-pixel coordinates (arc-seconds) that mappers close to one another in the source-plane(s), \
            used to speed up the non-linear sampling.
        pixel_scales_interp : float
            If `True`, expensive to compute mass profile deflection angles will be computed on a sparse grid and \
            interpolated to the grid, sub and blurring grids.

        renormalize_psf : bool
            If `True`, the PSF kernel is renormalized so all values sum to 1.0.
        read_noise : float
            The level of read-noise added to the simulated imaging by drawing from a Gaussian distribution with
