          The lens dataset is the collection of data_type (image, noise-map), a mask, grid, convolver \

          Parameters
          ----------
        grid_class : ag.Grid2D
            The type of grid used to create the image from the `Galaxy` and `Plane`. The options are `Grid2D`,
            `Grid2DIterate` and `Grid2DInterpolate` (see the `Grid2D` documentation for a description of these options).
        grid_inversion_class : ag.Grid2D
            The type of grid used to create the grid that maps the `Inversion` source pixels to the data's image-pixels.
            The options are `Grid2D`, `Grid2DIterate` and `Grid2DInterpolate` (see the `Grid2D` documentation for a
            description of these options).
        sub_size : int
            If the grid and / or grid_inversion use a `Grid2D`, this sets the sub-size used by the `Grid2D`.
        fractional_accuracy : float
            If the grid and / or grid_inversion use a `Grid2DIterate`, this sets the fractional accuracy it
            uses when evaluating functions.
        sub_steps : [int]
            If the grid and / or grid_inversion use a `Grid2DIterate`, this sets the steps the sub-size is increased by
            to meet the fractional accuracy when evaluating functions.
        pixel_scales_interp : float or (float, float)
            If the grid and / or grid_inversion use a `Grid2DInterpolate`, this sets the resolution of the interpolation
            grid.
        signal_to_noise_limit : float
            If input, the dataset's noise-map is rescaled such that no pixel has a signal-to-noise above the
            signa to noise limit.
