INSTALLATION:

pip install autolens


KNOWN ISSUES:

MultiNest:

MultiNest is a library used for non-linear sampling. Its source code is written in Fortran, and this needs compiling and 
linking to PyMultiNest. There have been issues on both Mac and Ubuntu in getting this set up and the best advise we can 
give currently is to follow the instructions on the pymultinest installation page:

http://johannesbuchner.github.io/PyMultiNest/install.html

Mac users - If the instructions above don't work due to c / fortran compiler issues, 
try the following instructions:

If you are still having issues, please contact us on SLACK.

We will address this issue in the short-term future, either by making a PyAutoLens conda install or 
making PyMultiNest an optional module.

NUMBA:

If you get issues referring to the library 'numba' (typically when using functions from the image module), this is 
because your pip has installed the incorrect version. To fix this:

pip uninstall numba
pip install numba==0.39.0

GetDist:

If you get issues referring to the library 'getdist', (typically after running a nonlinear search) this is 
because your pip has installed the incorrect version. To fix this:

pip uninstall getdist
pip install getdist==0.2.8.4.2
