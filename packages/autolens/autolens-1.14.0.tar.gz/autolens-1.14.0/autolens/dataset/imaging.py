        """
        The lens dataset is the collection of data (image, noise-map, PSF), a mask, grid, convolver \
        and other utilities that are used for modeling and fitting an image of a strong lens.

        Whilst the image, noise-map, etc. are loaded in 2D, the lens dataset creates reduced 1D arrays of each \
        for lens calculations.

        Parameters
        ----------
        imaging: im.Imaging
            The imaging data all in 2D (the image, noise-map, PSF, etc.)
        mask: msk.Mask2D
            The 2D mask that is applied to the image.
        sub_size : int
            The size of the sub-grid used for each lens SubGrid. E.g. a value of 2 grid each image-pixel on a 2x2 \
            sub-grid.
        psf_shape_2d : (int, int)
            The shape of the PSF used for convolving model image generated using analytic light profiles. A smaller \
            shape will trim the PSF relative to the input image PSF, giving a faster analysis run-time.
        positions : [[]]
            Lists of image-pixel coordinates (arc-seconds) that mappers close to one another in the source-plane(s), \
            used to speed up the non-linear sampling.
        pixel_scales_interp : float
            If `True`, expensive to compute mass profile deflection angles will be computed on a sparse grid and \
            interpolated to the grid, sub and blurring grids.
        inversion_pixel_limit : int or None
            The maximum number of pixels that can be used by an inversion, with the limit placed primarily to speed \
            up run.

        Parameters
        ----------
        psf : Kernel2D
            An arrays describing the PSF kernel of the image.
        exposure_time : float
            The exposure time of the simulated imaging.
        background_sky_level : float
            The level of the background sky of the simulated imaging.
        renormalize_psf : bool
            If `True`, the PSF kernel is renormalized so all values sum to 1.0.
        read_noise : float
            The level of read-noise added to the simulated imaging by drawing from a Gaussian distribution with
            sigma equal to the value `read_noise`.
        add_poisson_noise : bool
            Whether Poisson noise corresponding to photon count statistics on the imaging observation is added.
        noise_if_add_noise_false : float
            If noise is not added to the simulated dataset a `noise_map` must still be returned. This value gives
            the value of noise assigned to every pixel in the noise-map.
        noise_seed : int
            The random seed used to add random noise, where -1 corresponds to a random seed every run.
