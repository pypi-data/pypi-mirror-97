        For an input (y,x) Catersian coordinate create a buffed and upscaled square grid of (y,x) coordinates where:

            - The new grid of coordinates are buffed. For example, if buffer=1, the new grid will correspond to a 3x3 grid
              of coordinates centred on the input (y,x) value with spacings defined by the input pixel_scales.

            - The new grid is upscaled. For example, if upscale=2, the new grid will be at x2 the resolution of the input
              pixel_scale.

            Buffing and upscaling work together, so a buffer=2 and upscale=2 will produce a new 6x6 grid centred around the
            input coordinate.

            The `PositionFinder` works by locating pixels that trace closer to the source galaxy than neighboring pixels

        deflections_from_grid method to determine the (y,x) coordinates the multiple-images appear given a (y,x)
        source-centre coordinate in the source-plane.

        This is performed as follows:

         1) For an initial input grid, compute all deflection angles, map their values to source-plane and compute the
            distance of each traced coordinate to the source-plane centre.
         2) Find the 'peak' pixels on the image-plane grid. A peak pixel is one that traces closer to the centre of
            the source in the source-plane than it 8 direct neighboring adjacent pixels.
         3) For every peak pixel, create a higher resolution grid around it and centred on it and using this higher
            resolution grid find its peak pixel.

         This process thus finds a set of 'peak' pixels and iteratively refines their values by locating them for
         higher and higher resolution grids. The following occurances may happen during this process:

          - A peak pixel may 'split' into multiple images. This is to be expected, when genuine multiple images
            were previously merged into one due to the grid being too low resolution.

          - Image pixels which do not correspond to genuine multiple images may be detected as they meet the peak
            criteria. This can occurance in certain circumstances where a non-multiple image still traces closer than its
            8 neighbors. Depending on how the `PositionFinder` is being used these can be removed.
