Fitting Data
------------

``Tracer`` objects represent a strong lensing system, allowing us to create an image of how the lens and source
``Galaxy``'s. Now, lets use a ``Tracer`` to fit ``Imaging`` data of a strong lens, which we begin by loading
from .fits files as an ``Imaging`` object:

.. code-block:: bash

    dataset_path = "/path/to/dataset/folder"

    imaging = al.Imaging.from_fits(
        image_path=path.join(dataset_path, "image.fits"),
        psf_path=path.join(dataset_path, "psf.fits"),
        noise_map_path=path.join(dataset_path, "noise_map.fits"),
        pixel_scales=0.1,
    )

    aplt.Imaging.image(imaging=imaging)
    aplt.Imaging.noise_map(imaging=imaging)
    aplt.Imaging.psf(imaging=imaging)

Here's what our image, ``noise_map`` and point-spread function look like:

We now need to mask the data, so that regions where there is no signal (e.g. the edges) are omitted from the fit. To do
this we can use a ``Mask2D`` object, which for this example we'll create as a 3.0" circle.

.. code-block:: bash

    mask = al.Mask2D.circular(
        shape_native=imaging.shape_native, pixel_scales=imaging.pixel_scales, sub_size=1, radius=3.0
    )

    masked_imaging = al.MaskedImaging(imaging=imaging, mask=mask)

    aplt.Imaging.image(imaging=masked_imaging)

Here is what our image looks like with the mask applied, where **PyAutoLens** has automatically zoomed around the
``Mask2D`` to make the lensed source appear bigger:

Following the lensing API guide, we can make a ``Tracer`` from a collection of ``LightProfile``, ``MassProfile`` and
``Galaxy`` objects. This ``Tracer`` then allows us to create an image of the strong lens system.

By passing a ``Tracer`` and ``MaskImaging`` object to a ``FitImaging`` object, we create a model-image from the ``Tracer``.
The model-image is the image of the ``Tracer`` blurred with the ``Imaging`` dataset's PSF, ensuring our fit to the data
provides a like-with-like comparison.

.. code-block:: bash

    fit = al.FitImaging(masked_imaging=masked_imaging, tracer=tracer)

    fit_imaging_plotter = aplt.FitImagingPlotter(fit=fit)
fit_imaging_plotter.figures(model_image=True)

Here is how the ``Tracer``'s image and the ``FitImaging``'s model-image look; note how the model-image has been blurred
with the PSF of our dataset:

The ``FitImaging`` object does a lot more than just create the model-image, it also subtracts this image from
the data to produce a residual-map and weight these residuals by the noise to compute a chi-squared-map, both of which we can plot:

.. code-block:: bash

    aplt.FitImaging.residual_map(fit=fit)
    aplt.FitImaging.chi_squared_map(fit=fit)

For a good lens model where the ``Tracer``'s model image is representative of the strong lens system the residuals and
chi-squared values minimized:

In contrast, a bad lens model will show features in the residual-map and chi-squareds:

Most importantly, the ``FitImaging`` object also provides us with a log likelihood, a single value measure of how good
our ``Tracer`` fitted the dataset. If we can find a ``Tracer`` that produces a high log likelihood, we'll have a model
which is representative of our strong lens data! This task, called lens modeling, is covered in the next API overview.

Given a strong lens dataset, how do we determine a 'good' lens model? How do we determine the tracer (and therefore
combination of light profiles, mass profiles and galaxies) that minimize the residuals and chi-squared values?

This requires lens modeling, which uses a ``NonLinearSearch`` to fit many different tracers to the data.
This model-fitting is handled by our project **PyAutoFit**, a probabilistic programming language for non-linear model
fitting. Below, we setup our model as ``GalaxyModel`` objects, which repesent the galaxies we fit to our data:

If you are unfamilar data and model fitting, and unsure what terms like 'residuals', 'chi-sqaured' or 'likelihood' mean,
we'll explain all in chapter 1 of the **HowToLens** lecture series. Checkout the
