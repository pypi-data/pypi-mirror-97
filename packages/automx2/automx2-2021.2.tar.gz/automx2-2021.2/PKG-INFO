Description: # automx2: Email client configuration made easy
        
        automx2 makes configuring email accounts easy. It unites methods for automated mailbox configuration from Apple's
        [Mobileconfig](https://support.apple.com/de-de/guide/profile-manager/pmdbd71ebc9/mac), Microsoft's
        [Autodiscover](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/exchange/architecture/client-access/autodiscover?view=exchserver-2019)
        and Mozilla's [Autoconfig](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Mozilla/Thunderbird/Autokonfiguration) in one tool.
        automx2 is successor to automx. It has been designed to be easier to setup, easier to configure and easier to use.
