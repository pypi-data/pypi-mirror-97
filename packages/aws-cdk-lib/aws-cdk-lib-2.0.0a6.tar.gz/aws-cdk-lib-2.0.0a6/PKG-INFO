        The AWS CDK construct library provides APIs to define your CDK application and add
        CDK constructs to the application.
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Upgrade from CDK 1.x
        
        When upgrading from CDK 1.x, remove all dependencies to individual CDK packages
        from your dependencies file and follow the rest of the sections.
        
        ### Installation
        
        To use this package, you need to declare this package and the `constructs` package as
        dependencies.
        
        According to the kind of project you are developing:
        
        * For projects that are CDK libraries, declare them both under the `devDependencies`
          **and** `peerDependencies` sections.
        * For CDK apps, declare them under the `dependencies` section only.
        
        ### Use in your code
        
        #### Classic import
        
        You can use a classic import to get access to each service namespaces:
        
        ```python
        # Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
        from aws_cdk_lib import core, aws_s3 as s3
        
        app = core.App()
        stack = core.Stack(app, "TestStack")
        
        s3.Bucket(stack, "TestBucket")
        ```
        
        #### Barrel import
        
        Alternatively, you can use "barrel" imports:
        
        ```python
        # Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
        from aws_cdk_lib import App, Stack
        from aws_cdk_lib.aws_s3 import Bucket
        
        app = App()
        stack = Stack(app, "TestStack")
        
        Bucket(stack, "TestBucket")
        ```
