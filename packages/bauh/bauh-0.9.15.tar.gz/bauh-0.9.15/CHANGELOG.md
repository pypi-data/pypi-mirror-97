    - checking if the internet connection is available before trying to upgrade the selected packages
    
### Fixes
- AppImage
    - crashing when trying to upgrade and the internet connection is off
    
- Arch
    - Upgrading: when an installed package does not meet a dependency expression, it is displayed to be installed (e.g: 'optimus-manager-qt' relies on 'optimus-manager' >= 1.4, but the current provided version is '1.3'. Even so, 'optimus-manager' will be displayed to be installed)
    - Not checking the dependency version expression when it is only available on AUR
    - Not properly treating a dependency version before comparing with others (could display that a given dependency was not found)
    
- Flatpak
    - displaying duplicate runtimes on the upgrade summary when a runtime is available at the system and user levels
    - installation level tooltip not being localized
    - displaying installation level tooltip for not installed apps

- Arch
    - AUR
        - [rebuild-detector](https://github.com/maximbaz/rebuild-detector) integration [#139](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh/issues/139)
            - if a package needs to be rebuilt, it will be marked for update (rebuild-detector must be installed on your system, but it is not a hard requirement). 
            - if you hold the mouse over the package 'version' (on the table), a tip will be displayed with the message "It needs to be reinstalled".
            - this integration can be controlled though the new settings property **aur_rebuild_detector** (default: true).

    - minor improvements
    
### Fixes
- Arch
    - crashing when information of a given package is not available
    - displaying "provided" repository packages on the search results (e.g: **nvidia** would appear as a package)
    - calling pacman to read installed packages when "Repositories" and "AUR" properties are set to "false" (it would not display the packages, but the call was unnecessary being done)
    - not displaying installed AUR packages when AUR support is disabled
    - displaying packages removed from AUR as AUR packages
    - downloading AUR index during the initialization process when AUR support is disabled
- Flatpak

## [0.9.11] 2020-12-30
### New system requirements
- **python-dateutil**: better Python library for date handling (install the equivalent package for your Linux distribution before upgrading bauh)
- **git**: for AUR support.

### Improvements
- AppImage
    - database updater daemon dropped. Now the database is only downloaded/updated during the initialization process (if it is considered expired). Its expiration are controlled through the new settings property **database.expiration** (in minutes. default: 60 minutes. Use 0 so it is always updated).
    <p align="center">
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinifmor/bauh-files/master/pictures/releases/0.9.11/appim_db_exp.png">
    </p>
    
    - old settings properties were dropped (**db_updater.interval**, **db_updated.enabled**)
    - database files (**apps.db** and **releases.db**) are now stored at **~/.cache/bauh/appimage**
    - displaying a warning when the cached database files could not be found
    - new custom action **Update database** to perform a database update anytime:
    <p align="center">
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinifmor/bauh-files/master/pictures/releases/0.9.11/appim_up_db.png">
    </p>

- Arch
    - AUR
        - upgrade checking now considers modification dates as well (needed because not all AUR packages follow versioning standards)
        - downgrade: using the cached package commit (if available) to determine the correct version to downgrade (otherwise only the version will be used -> old behavior)
        - history: using the cached package commit (if available) to properly determine the current version (otherwise only the version will be used -> old behavior)
        - the task responsible for generating the local index is displayed on the initialization dialog
        - the index is not always being updated during the initialization process. It its kept for a period of time controlled by the settings property **aur_idx_exp** (in HOURS -> default: 1). (P.S: this index is always updated when a package is installed/upgraded)
        <p align="center">
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinifmor/bauh-files/master/pictures/releases/0.9.11/aur_idx_exp.png">
        </p>
    
        - the index is now stored at **~/.cache/bauh/arch/aur/index.txt**.
    - info window
        - date fields format changed to numbers (e.g: Thu Dec 17 17:19:55 2020 -> 2020-12-17 17:19:55)
    - new settings property "categories_exp": it defines the expiration time (in HOURS) of the packages categories mapping file stored in disc. Default: 24 hours.
    <p align="center">
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinifmor/bauh-files/master/pictures/releases/0.9.11/cats_exp.png">
    </p>
- Core
    - new settings property **boot.load_apps** (General -> Load apps after startup) that allows the user to choose if the installed packages/suggestions should be loaded on the management panel after the initialization process. Default: true.
    <p align="center">
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinifmor/bauh-files/master/pictures/releases/0.9.11/load_apps.png">
    </p>

- Snap
    - new settings property "categories_exp": it defines the expiration time (in HOURS) of the Snaps categories mapping file stored in disc. Default: 24 hours.
    <p align="center">
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinifmor/bauh-files/master/pictures/releases/0.9.11/cats_exp.png">
    </p>

- Web
    - now the environment settings are cached in disk for 24 hours. This period can be controlled through the new settings property **environment.cache_exp** (in HOURS -> default: 24). Use **0** so that they are always updated).
    - now the suggestions are cached in disk for 24 hours. This period can be controlled through the new settings property **suggestions.cache_exp** (in hours -> default: 24 hours. Use **0** so that they are always updated).
    <p align="center">
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinifmor/bauh-files/master/pictures/releases/0.9.11/web_exp.png">
    </p>
    
    - displaying the "Indexing suggestions" task during the initialization process
    - code refactoring

- all types now display an initialization task **Checking configuration file** responsible to create/update the respective configuration file
- minor translation improvements
        

### Fixes
- AppImage
    - some installed applications cannot be launched by their desktop entries (regression from **0.9.10**) [#155](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh/issues/155). If any of your installed AppImages are affected by this issue, just reinstall them.
- Arch
    - some operations are keeping the wrong substatus during specific scenarios
    - not able to install a package that replaces another (regression introduced in **0.9.9**)
    - displaying installed packages that have been removed from AUR when AUR supported is disabled
- Flatpak
    - crashing for Flatpak 1.6.5 when there are updates [#145](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh/issues/145)
    - history: not highlighting the correct version (regression introduced **0.9.9**)
- UI
    - number input fields are not displaying **0**


## [0.9.10] 2020-12-11
### Features
- Web
    - allowing generated apps to interact with protected/encrypted content (DRM) through a new installation option [#49](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh/issues/49):
    <p align="center">
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinifmor/bauh-files/master/pictures/releases/0.9.10/widevine.png">
    </p>
    
    - this new installation option uses an alternative Electron implementation provided by [castLabs](https://github.com/castlabs/electron-releases). 
    - **nativefier** handles the switch between the official Electron and the custom provided by castLabs.

### Improvements
- Web
    - environment tools upgraded (settings are now retrieved from this new [URL](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh-files/blob/master/web/env/v1/environment.yml):
    ```
        - nodejs: 12.18.0 -> 14.15.1
        - nativefier: 7.7.1 -> 42.0.2
        - electron: 5.0.13 -> 11.0.3
    ```

### Fixes

    - missing **Exec** parameters on generated desktop entries [#152](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh/issues/152)
    - crashing when trying to retrieve an AppImage history not available on the database anymore (downgrade is affected as well)
- Flatpak
    - crashing when trying to downgrade (regression introduced in **0.9.9**)
- Snap
    - Channel changing status (UI)
- UI
    - upgrading: only requesting the root password if required [#151](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh/issues/151)
    - install/uninstall/downgrade + specific backup settings could lead to crashing
    - bauh release notification not working properly
- Web
    - installation options window size
    
### Changes
- UI
    - "backup" dialog is displayed before the "trim" dialog during the upgrade process (if both are enabled)



## [0.9.9] 2020-12-02
### Features
- Themes (stylesheets)
    - new settings property **theme**: it points to a file defining a set of customizations over the current style (QT). In other words, a stylesheet file. At the moment 3 will come bundled with bauh:
        - [Light](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinifmor/bauh-files/master/pictures/releases/0.9.9/light.png): default light theme
        - [Darcula](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinifmor/bauh-files/master/pictures/releases/0.9.9/darcula.png): dark based on JetBrain's Darcula theme
        - [Sublime](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinifmor/bauh-files/master/pictures/releases/0.9.9/sublime.png): dark based on Sublime Text's editor theme
    - the theme can be changed through the new lower bar button:
    <p align="center">
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinifmor/bauh-files/master/pictures/releases/0.9.9/bt_themes.png">
    </p>
    
    - custom themes can be provided as well. More information at [README#custom-themes](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh/tree/master#custom-themes)
        
### Improvements
- Flatpak
    - history: only displaying the commit's 8 first characters

- UI
    - root dialog design and behavior
    - tooltip for the label displaying the number of applications on the table/available [#138](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh/issues/138)
    - screenshots: 
        - dialog resizing behavior
        - "loading" message displays the number of images being loaded
    - "name filter" now requires ENTER or click to be triggered
    - some app actions icons are now displayed with a different picture when disabled to prevent confusion (e.g: launch, screenshots) [#138](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh/issues/138)
    - suggestions button moved to the lower bar (label removed)
    <p align="center">
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinifmor/bauh-files/master/pictures/releases/0.9.9/suggestions.png">
    </p>
    
- Settings
    - new property **system_theme** (UI -> System theme): merges the system's theme/stylesheet with bauh's (default: false)
    - property **style** renamed to **qt_style** and its default value now is **fusion**. If this property is set to **null**, **fusion** will be considered as well. Fusion is the default style that all default themes (stylesheets) are based on, so if you change this property the final style may not look like as expected.
    - **Applications displayed** property (Interface) tooltip now informs that 0 (zero) can be used for no limit [#138](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh/issues/138)

- Parameters
    - new parameter **--offline**: it assumes the internet connection is off. Useful if the connection is bad/unstable and you just want to check your installed packages.

### Fixes
- AppImage
    - not able to launch AppImage files installed inside folders named with spaces (e.g: "/path/my folder/abc.appimage")
    
- Arch
    - search: not able to find installed packages that were renamed on the repositories (e.g: xapps -> xapp)
    - not able to replace an installed package for a new one that replaces it during conflict resolutions (e.g: xapp replaces xapps)
    - AUR: not able to find some repository dependencies when their names are not an exact match (e.g: sc-controller [0.4.7-1] relies on "pylibacl". This dependency now is called "python-pylibacl")
    
- UI
    - history dialog: not able to maximize/minimize it on some systems
    - wrong tooltips

### i18n
- French translations by [KINFOO](https://github.com/KINFOO): [#143](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh/pull/143)


## [0.9.8] 2020-10-02

- Flatpak
    - not displaying the runtimes icons on the summary window

## [0.9.7] 2020-09-11
### Features
- Arch
    - AUR
        - allowing to edit the PKGBUILD file of a package to be installed/upgraded/downgraded. If enabled, a popup will be displayed during these actions allowing the PKGBUILD to be edited.
        <p align="center">
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinifmor/bauh-files/master/pictures/releases/0.9.7/aur_pkgbuild.png">
        </p>
        - mark a given PKGBUILD of a package as editable (if the property above is enabled, the same behavior will be applied)
         <p align="center">
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinifmor/bauh-files/master/pictures/releases/0.9.7/mark_pkgbuild.png">
         </p>
        - unmark a given PKGBUILD of a package as editable (it prevents the behavior described above to happen)
        <p align="center">
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinifmor/bauh-files/master/pictures/releases/0.9.7/unmark_pkgbuild.png">
         </p>

### Improvements
- AppImage
    - Manual file installation/upgrade:
        - default search path set to '~/Downloads'
        - trying to auto-fill the 'Name' and 'Version' fields
- Arch
    - initializing task "Organizing data from installed packages" is taking about 80% less time (now is called "Indexing packages data") [#131](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh/issues/131)
    - upgrade
        - upgrading firstly the keyring packages declared in **SyncFirst** (**/etc/pacman.conf**) to avoid pacman downloading issues
        - only removing packages after downloading the required ones
        - summary: displaying the reason a given package must be installed 
        <p align="center">
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinifmor/bauh-files/master/pictures/releases/0.9.7/arch_install_reason.png">
        </p>
        - checking specific version requirements and marking packages as "cannot upgrade" when these requirements are not met (e.g: package A depends on version 1.0 of B. If A and B were selected to upgrade, and B would be upgrade to 2.0, then B would be excluded from the transaction. This new checking behavior can be disabled through the property (**check_dependency_breakage**):
        <p align="center">
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinifmor/bauh-files/master/pictures/releases/0.9.7/arch_dep_break_settings.png">
        </p>
        
        - allowing the user to bypass dependency breakage scenarios (a popup will be displayed)
        - new settings property **suggest_unneeded_uninstall**: defines if the dependencies apparently no longer necessary associated with the uninstalled packages should be suggested for uninstallation. When this property is enabled it automatically disables the property **suggest_optdep_uninstall**. Default: false (to prevent new users from making mistakes)
        - new settings property **suggest_optdep_uninstall**: defines if the optional dependencies associated with uninstalled packages should be suggested for uninstallation. Only the optional dependencies that are not dependencies of other packages will be suggested. Default: false (to prevent new users from making mistakes)
        <p align="center">
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinifmor/bauh-files/master/pictures/releases/0.9.7/arch_opt_uni.png">
        </p>
        
    - AUR
        - caching the PKGBUILD file used for the package installation/upgrade/downgrade (**~/.cache/bauh/arch/installed/$pkgname/PKGBUILD**). Directory: **~/.cache/bauh/arch/installed/my_package/PKGBUILD
        - new settings property **aur_build_dir** -> it allows to define a custom build dir.
        <p align="center">
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinifmor/bauh-files/master/pictures/releases/0.9.7/aur_buildir.png">
        </p>
        
        - new settings property **aur_remove_build_dir** -> it defines if a package's generated build directory should be removed after the operation is finished (installation, upgrading, ...). Default: true
        - new settings property **aur_build_only_chosen**: some AUR packages have a common file definition declaring several packages to be built. When this property is 'true' only the package the user select to install will be built (unless its name is different from those declared in the PKGBUILD base). With a 'null' value a popup asking if the user wants to build all of them will be displayed. 'false' will build and install all packages. Default: true.
        <p align="center">
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinifmor/bauh-files/master/pictures/releases/0.9.7/aur_build_chosen.png">
        </p>
        
    - "Multi-threaded download (repositories)" is not the default behavior anymore (current pacman download approach is faster). If your settings has this property set as 'Yes', just change it to 'No'.
    - preventing a possible error when the optional deps of a given package cannot be found

- Flatpak
    - creating the exports path **~/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share** (if it does not exist) and adding it to install/upgrade/downgrade/remove commands path to prevent warning messages. [#128](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh/issues/128)
    - downgrade function refactored
- Snap
    - full support refactored to use the Snapd socket instead of the Ubuntu's old Snap API (which was recently disabled). Now the 'read' operations are faster, a only the icon is cached to the disk.

- UI
    - faster initialization dialog: improved the way it checks for finished tasks
    - 'name' filter now holds for 3 seconds instead of 2 before being applied
    - minor improvements

### Fixes
- AppImage
    - manual file installation
        - crashing if the AppImage icon is not on the extracted folder root path [#132](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh/issues/132)
        - not properly retrieving the 'Category' field options translated
    - some environment variable are not available during the launch process
- Arch
    - not able to upgrade a package that explicitly defines a conflict with itself (e.g: grub)
    - downloading some AUR packages sources twice when multi-threaded download is enabled
    - upgrade summary
        - not displaying all packages that must be uninstalled
        - displaying "required size" for packages that must be uninstalled

        - importing PGP keys (Generic error). Now the key server is specified: `gpg --keyserver SERVER --recv-key KEYID` (the server address is retrieved from [bauh-files](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh-files/blob/master/arch/gpgservers.txt))
        - not installing the correct package built when several are generated (e.g: linux-xanmod-lts)
        - some packages dependencies cannot be downloaded due to the wrong download URL (missing the 'pkgbase' field to determine the proper url)

## [0.9.3] 2020-05-12
### Features
- new **restore** action to restore all bauh settings and cache through the 'custom actions' button (**+**). It is equivalent to the command `bauh --reset`.

### Improvements
- some custom actions not related to installed packages state will not refresh the table after succeeded

### Fixes

    - not displaying some priority search results at the top of the table


## [0.8.3] - 2020-02-13
### Improvements
- New update lifecycle:
    - now every package manager must provide all requirements before upgrading all selected packages ( can be disabled through the settings file **~/.config/bauh/config.yml** or the UI )
    - now every package manager must provide the best upgrade order for all the selected packages ( can be disabled through the settings file **~/.config/bauh/config.yml** or the UI )
- AUR
    - allowing the user to bypass checksum errors when installing / upgrading / downgrading packages
    - improved how missing dependencies are checked when installing a new package ( the old way was not identifying some missing dependencies of **anbox-git** ). It is possible to use the old algorithm by setting **simple_checking** to **true** in **~/.config/bauh/arch.yml**. More information at [README](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh/#aur--arch-).
    - checking architecture dependencies (x86_64, i686)
    - architecture dependencies are displayed on the info window as well
    - optimizations to speed up zst packages building
    - showing a warning message when trying to install / update / downgrade a package with the root user
- UI:

## [0.8.2] - 2020-01-31
### Features
- New **Settings** panel ( displayed when the lower **Settings** button is clicked ). It allows to change all settings.

### Improvements
- Flatpak
    - configuration file ( **flatpak.yml** ) will be created during the initialization ( on **0.8.1** it would only be created during the first app installation )
- AUR
    - the custom **makepkg.conf** generated at **~/.config/bauh/arch** will enable **ccache** if available on the system
    - downgrading time reduced due to the fix described in ***Fixes***
    - package databases synchronization once a day ( or every device reboot ) before the first package installation / upgrade / downgrade. This behavior can be disabled on **~/.config/arch.yml** / or the new settings panel
    ```
    sync_databases: true  # enabled by default
    ```
- Configuration ( **~/.config/bauh/config.yml** )
    - new property **hdpi** allowing to disable HDPI improvements
    ```
    ui:
        hdpi: true # enabled by default
    ```
  - new property **auto_scale** activates Qt auto screen scale factor ( **QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR** ). It fixes scaling issues 
    for some desktop environments ( like Gnome ) [#1](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh/issues/1)
    ```
     ui:
        auto_scale: false  # disabled by default
    ```
### Fixes
- AUR
    - not treating **makedepends** as a list during dependency checking ( **anbox-git** installation was crashing )
    - not considering the package name itself as **provided** during dependency checking ( **anbox-git** installation was crashing )
    - not pre-downloading some source files ( e.g: from **anbox-image** )
    - not able to install packages based on other packages ( package name != package base ). e.g: **anbox-modules-dkms-git** > **anbox-git**
    - downgrade: pre-downloading sources from the latest version instead of the older
- Flatpak
    - downgrade: displaying "No Internet connection" when an error happens during commits reading

- Flatpak
    - the application name tooltip now displays the installation level. e.g: **gedit ( system )**

## [0.8.0] 2019-12-24
### Features
- Native Web applications support:
    - if an URL is typed on the search bar, a native web application result will be displayed on the table.
    - bauh relies on [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) and [nativefier](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier) to install the Web applications, but there is no need to have them installed on your system. Bauh will create its own installation environment with these technologies in **~/.local/share/bauh/web/env**.
    - suggestions are retrieved from [suggestions.txt](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh-files/blob/master/web/suggestions.yml)
    - requires only **python-beautifulsoup4** and **python-lxml** to be enabled
- **Suggestions** button: it shows some application suggestions 

### Improvements
- configuration file **~/.config/bauh/config.json** renamed to **~/.config/bauh/config.yml**
- some parameters and environment variables were moved to the configuration file ( **~/.config/bauh/config.yml** )
```
disk_cache:  # old '--disk_cache'
  enabled: true
download:
  icons: true # old '--download-icons'
  multithreaded: true  # old '--download-mthread'
gems: null 
locale: null  # old '--locale'
memory_cache:
  data_expiration: 3600 # old '--cache-exp'
  icon_expiration: 300  # old '--icon-exp'
suggestions:
  by_type: 10  # new -> defines the max number of suggestions by package type
  enabled: true  # old '--sugs'
system:
  notifications: true  # old '--system-notifications'
  single_dependency_checking: false  # old '---check-packaging-once'
ui:
  style: null  
  table:
    max_displayed: 50  # old '--max-displayed'
  tray:
    default_icon: null  # old environment variable 'BAUH_TRAY_DEFAULT_ICON_PATH'
    updates_icon: null  # old environment variable 'BAUH_TRAY_UPDATES_ICON_PATH'
updates:
  check_interval: 30  # old '--check-interval'

```
- The default update checking interval is now 30 seconds
- New tray icons loading priority: 
    1) Icon paths defined in **~/.config/bauh/config.yml**
    2) Icons from the system with the following names: `bauh_tray_default` and `bauh_tray_updates`
    3) Own packaged icons
- Now bauh considers the default system icon for the notifications and panel. If there is none, then it will use its own.
- AppImage:
    - cleaning the downloaded database files when **--reset** is passed as parameter
    - environment variables **BAUH_APPIMAGE_DB_UPDATER** and **BAUH_APPIMAGE_DB_UPDATER_TIME** dropped in favor of the new configuration file located at **~/.config/bauh/appimage.yml**
    - suggestions are now retrieved from [suggestions.txt](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh-files/blob/master/appimage/suggestions.txt)
- AUR:
    - The AUR indexer daemon is not running every 20 minutes anymore. It will only run during the boot, and will generate the optimized index
    at **/tmp/bauh/arch/aur.txt**. This new behavior does not harm the current experience, and reduces memory usage. More information about this behavior in [README](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh/blob/master/README.md).
    - Environment variable **BAUH_ARCH_AUR_INDEX_UPDATER** dropped in favor of the behavior described above.
    - Environment variables **BAUH_ARCH_OPTIMIZE** and **BAUH_ARCH_CHECK_SUBDEPS** dropped in favor of the new configuration file located at **~/.config/bauh/arch.yml**
    - suggestions are now retrieved from [suggestions.txt](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh-files/blob/master/aur/suggestions.txt)  
- Flatpak:
    - suggestions are now retrieved from [suggestions.txt](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh-files/blob/master/flatpak/suggestions.txt)
- Snap:
    - suggestions are now retrieved from [suggestions.txt](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh-files/blob/master/snap/suggestions.txt)

    - displaying **makedepends** and **checkdepends** in the info window
    - Some AUR labels have been changed to not confuse the user

- Adding all english (**en**) i18n keys to help people with the application translation
- AppImage
    - AppImage updater daemon replaced by a default Python thread to reduce memory usage
- AUR
    - The optimized **makepkg.conf** file is now generated at **~/.config/bauh/arch/makepkg.conf** and passed as a parameter during package builds to not provoke the auto-merge of **/etc/makepkg.conf** and the old generated **~/.makepkg.conf**.
    (P.S: if your **~/.makepkg.conf** was generated by bauh, consider deleting it as it will be useless for bauh now and may impact your other Arch compilation tools). Behavior discussed in [#30](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh/issues/30).
    - Removing an unnecessary **prepare** step executed during dependency checking reducing the packages installation time. Also this step was preventing some packages to install due to its repeated execution ( e.g: xdman )
    - Now AUR packages are enabled by default, but a warning is displayed in the installation dialog
    - New package suggestions
- Caching Snap and Flatpak suggestions [#23](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh/issues/23)
