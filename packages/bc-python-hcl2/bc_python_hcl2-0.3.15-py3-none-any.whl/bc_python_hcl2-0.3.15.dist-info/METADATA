# Python HCL2

A parser for [HCL2](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl2/blob/master/hcl/spec.md) written in Python using 
[Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark). This parser only supports HCL2 and isn't backwards compatible
with HCL v1. It can be used to parse any HCL2 config file such as Terraform.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

python-hcl2 requires Python 3.6.0 or higher to run.

### Installing

This package can be installed using `pip`

```sh
pip3 install python-hcl2
```

### Usage
```python
import hcl2
with(open('foo.tf', 'r')) as file:
    dict = hcl2.load(file)
```

## Building From Source

For development, `tox>=2.9.1` is recommended.

### Running Tests

python-hcl2 uses `tox`. You will need to install tox with `pip install tox`.
Running `tox` will automatically execute linters as well as the unit tests.

You can also run them individually with the `-e` argument.

For example, `tox -e py37-unit` will run the unit tests for python 3.7

To see all the available options, run `tox -l`.
