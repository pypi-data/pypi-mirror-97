# --------------------( SYNOPSIS                          )--------------------
# GitHub-specific continuous integration (CI) configuration, enabling the usual
# GitHub Actions workflow for pure-Python packages exercised by "tox".
#
# --------------------( CAVEATS                           )--------------------
# *THIS CONFIGURATION SHOULD PERFORM ONLY THE BARE MINIMUM NUMBER OF TESTS.*
# Regrettably, tests *NOT* safeguarding the quality of the core Python package
# installed by this project should *NOT* be run. This includes:
#
# * Tests conditionally dependent on third-party packages such as:
#    * The scientific stack (e.g., NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib). Scientific
#      packages tend to be large and thus expensive to install, costing scarce
#      CI minutes while contributing little of note.
#    * The documentation stack (e.g., RTD, Sphinx, docutils). Documentation
#      packages also tend to be large. Unlike the scientific stack, these
#      packages are miserably slow at runtime -- presumably due to
#      inefficiencies in the docutils reStructuredText (reST) parser. Moreover,
#      since Read The Docs (RTD) already builds documentation and thus pays
#      these costs on our behalf, we have little incentive to do so ourselves.
#
# GitHub currently only allots public repositories 2,000 GitHub Actions minutes
# per month for an average of 66.66 minutes per day. While this test suite is
# fast, it's also run under multiple CPython and PyPy versions. That is still
# fast locally. Unfortunately, Azure (i.e., Microsoft's cloud computing
# platform that unsurprisingly also hosts GitHub Actions) is slow.
#
# Each CI run triggered by this workflow currently costs this project ~5 free
# GitHub Actions minutes on average despite running substantially faster on a
# dual-core AMD Athlon(tm) II X2 240 manufactured before the auspicious birth
# of Linus Torvalds. Since this project *MUST* support multiple CI runs per day
# (e.g., to test pull requests), we are rapidly bumping up against real-world
# business constraints.

        # including:
        # * The latest Long-Term Service (LTS) release of Ubuntu Linux, still
        #   the most popular Linux distro and thus a sane baseline.
        # * The latest *whatever* release of Microsoft Windows. Although Linux
        #   and macOS are both POSIX-compliant and thus crudely comparable from
        #   the low-level CLI perspective, Windows is POSIX-noncompliant and
        #   thus heavily divergent from both macOS and Linux.
        # * The latest *whatever* release of Apple macOS. We don't particularly
        #   need to exercise tests on macOS, given the platform's patent
        #   POSIX-compliant low-level similarities to Linux, but... what the
        #   heck. Why not? Since this is the lowest priority, we defer macOS
        #   testing until last.
