  :attr:`typing.Union` attributes are distinct.
* Less than Python 3.9.0, the :attr:`typing.Optional` attribute reduces to the
  :attr:`typing.Union` attribute, in which case this set is technically
  semantically redundant. Since tests of both object identity and set
  membership are ``O(1)``, this set incurs no significant performance penalty
  versus direct usage of the :attr:`typing.Union` attribute and is thus
  unconditionally used as is irrespective of Python version.
