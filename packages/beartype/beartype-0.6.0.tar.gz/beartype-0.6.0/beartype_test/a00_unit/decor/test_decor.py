**Beartype decorator type hint-agnostic unit tests.**

This submodule unit tests high-level functionality of the
:func:`beartype.beartype` decorator independent of lower-level type hinting
concerns (e.g., PEP-compliance, PEP-noncompliance).

#FIXME: Validate that generator-based coroutines behave as expected, given the
#following snippet in the documentation for this third-party utility:
#    https://smarie.github.io/python-makefun
#
#    @beartype
#    def my_gencoroutine_impl(first_msg):
#        second_msg = (yield first_msg)
#        yield second_msg
#
#    # Verify that the new func is a correct generator-based coroutine.
#    cor = my_gencoroutine_impl('hi')
#    assert next(cor) == 'hi'
#    assert cor.send('chaps') == 'chaps'
#    cor.send('ola')  # raises StopIteration
#FIXME: Likewise, for async-based coroutines:
#    import asyncio
#
#    @beartype
#    async def my_native_coroutine_impl(what, sleep_time):
#        await asyncio.sleep(sleep_time)
#        return what
#
#    # verify that the new function is a native coroutine and behaves correctly
#    event_loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
#    event_loop.run_until_complete(my_native_coroutine_impl('yum', 5))
#    assert out == 'yum'
#
#In the latter case, note that the usage of an asynchronous event loop
#justifiably complicates matters. Simple unit testing methodology fails here.
#Instead, we need to leverage an asyncio-aware approach. The most popular are:
#
#* "pytest-asyncio", a third-party pytest plugin providing a
#  @pytest.mark.asyncio decorator facilitating trivial asynchronous testing.
#  We'd rather not add yet another testing dependency merely to test one or two
#  asynchronous edge cases, however. Instead...
#* See this extremely well-written blog post:
#  https://medium.com/ideas-at-igenius/testing-asyncio-python-code-with-pytest-a2f3628f82bc
#  The core idea here is that we define a custom pytest fixture instantiating
#  an "asyncio" event loop enabling downstream unit tests to run asynchronous
#  callables under that loop: e.g.,
#      import asyncio
#
#      @pytest.fixture
#      def event_loop():
#          loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
#          yield loop
#          loop.close()
#
#      def test_muh_async_func(event_loop):
#          assert 'nope' == event_loop.run_until_complete(muh_async_func('wut', 0))
#
#Self-obviously, the latter is the way to go for us. A trivial five-line
#fixture dominates a non-trivial third-party dependency any asynchronous day.
