        Bittensor is a p2p-market which rewards the production of machine intelligence with a digital token called Tao. Peers in the system train models by mining knowledge from unsupervised datasets to share with others. Consumers access the network and distill what they learn into production models. The network is collectively-run, open-source, open-access, decentralized, and incentivized to produce state-of-the-art intelligence. For more info, read our [paper](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5cfe9427d35b15fd0afc4687/6021920718efe27873351f68_bittensor.pdf).
        
        # Running a miner
        
        Paste the below command in a MacOS Terminal or Ubuntu shell prompt and follow the instructions. The script will install necessary dependencies and then install Bittensor.
        ```
        $ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opentensor/bittensor/master/scripts/install.sh)"
        ```
        If you wish to run bittensor through a docker container, create a new wallet, and run docker-compose:
        ```
        $ bin/bittensor-cli new_default                                                     # Generate default keys	
        $ docker-compose up
        ```
