# bmi-topography

*bmi-topography* is a Python library to fetch and cache
NASA [Shuttle Radar Topography Mission](https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/) (SRTM)
land elevation data
using the [OpenTopography](https://opentopography.org/)
[REST API](https://portal.opentopography.org/apidocs/).

The *bmi-topography* library provides access to the following global raster datasets:

* SRTM GL3 (90m)
* SRTM GL1 (30m)
* SRTM GL1 (Ellipsoidal)

The *bmi-topography* library includes an API and CLI that accept
the dataset type,
a latitude-longiture bounding box, and
the output file format.
Data are downloaded from OpenTopography and cached locally.
The cache is checked before downloading new data.
Data from a cached file can optionally be loaded into an
[xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/)
[DataArray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/api.html#dataarray)
using the experimental [open_rasterio](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/generated/xarray.open_rasterio.html#xarray.open_rasterio) method.

The *bmi-topography* API is wrapped with a
[Basic Model Interface](https://bmi.readthedocs.io) (BMI),
which provides a standard set of functions for coupling with data or models
that also expose a BMI.
More information on the BMI can found in its
[documentation](https://bmi.readthedocs.io).

## Installation

Install the latest stable release of *bmi-topography* with `pip`:
```
pip install bmi-topography
```
or with `conda`:
```
conda install -c conda-forge bmi-topography
```

The *bmi-topography* library can also be built and installed from source.
The library uses several other open source libraries,
so a convenient way of building and installing it is within a
[conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).
After cloning or downloding the *bmi-topography*
[repository](https://github.com/csdms/bmi-topography),
change into the repository directory
and set up a conda environment with the included environment file:
```
conda env create --file=environment.yml
```
Then build and install *bmi-topography* from source with
```
make install
```

## Documentation

Documentation for the *bmi-topography* API and CLI 
is available at https://bmi-topography.readthedocs.io.

## Examples

A brief example of using the *bmi-topography* API is given in the following steps.

Start a Python session and import the `Topography` class:
```python
>>> from bmi_topography import Topography
```

For convenience,
a set of default parameter values for `Topography` are included in the class definition.
Copy these and modify them with custom values:
```python
>>> params = Topography.DEFAULT.copy()
>>> params["south"] = 39.75
>>> params["north"] = 40.25
>>> params["west"] = -105.25
>>> params["east"] = -104.75
>>> params
{'dem_type': 'SRTMGL3',
 'south': 39.75,
 'north': 40.25,
 'west': -105.25,
 'east': -104.75,
 'output_format': 'GTiff',
 'cache_dir': '~/.bmi_topography'}
```
These coordinate values represent an area around Boulder, Colorado.

Make a instance of `Topography` with these parameters:
```python
>>> boulder = Topography(**params)
```
then fetch the data from OpenTopography:
```python
>>> boulder.fetch()
PosixPath('/Users/mpiper/.bmi_topography/SRTMGL3_39.75_-105.25_40.25_-104.75.tif')
```
This step might take a few moments,
and it will increase for requests of larger areas.
Note that the file has been saved to a local cache directory.

Load the data into an xarray `DataArray` for further work:
```python
>>> boulder.load()
<xarray.DataArray 'SRTMGL3' (band: 1, y: 600, x: 600)>
[360000 values with dtype=int16]
Coordinates:
  * band     (band) int64 1
  * y        (y) float64 40.25 40.25 40.25 40.25 ... 39.75 39.75 39.75 39.75
  * x        (x) float64 -105.3 -105.2 -105.2 -105.2 ... -104.8 -104.8 -104.8

## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here\'s how to set up *bmi-topography* for local
development.

1.  Fork the *bmi-topography* repo on GitHub.

2.  Clone your fork locally:

    ``` {.shell}
    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/bmi-topography.git
    ```

3.  Install your local copy into a conda environment. A conda enviroment file is
    supplied at the root of the repository. Assuming you have conda installed,
    this is how you set up your fork for local development:

    ``` {.shell}
    $ cd bmi-topography
    $ conda env create --file=environment.yml
    $ conda activate topography
    $ make install
    ```

4.  Create a branch for local development:

    ``` {.shell}
    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

    Now you can make your changes locally.

5.  When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass
    flake8 and the tests:

    ``` {.shell}
    $ make lint
    $ make test
    ```

    Both flake8 and pytest are included in the environment.

6.  Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

    ``` {.shell}
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

7.  Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1.  The pull request should include tests.
2.  If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated.
    Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add
    the feature to the list in README.rst.
3.  The pull request need only work with Python >= 3.8.


## Deploying

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy. To make a new release,
you will need to have
[zest.releaser](https://zestreleaser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
installed, which can be installed with *pip*,

``` {.bash}
$ pip install zest.releaser[recommended]
```

Make sure all your changes are committed (including an entry in
CHANGES.md). Then run,

``` {.bash}
$ fullrelease
```

This will create a new tag and alert the *bmi-topography* feedstock on
*conda-forge* that there is a new release.
