Briefcase is a tool for converting a Python project into a standalone native
application. You can package projects for:

* Mac
* Windows
* Linux
* iPhone/iPad
* Android

Support for AppleTV, watchOS, wearOS and web deployments is planned.

If you want to see Briefcase in action, try the `BeeWare tutorial
<https://beeware.readthedocs.io>`__. That tutorial walks you through the
process of creating and packaging a new application with Briefcase.
