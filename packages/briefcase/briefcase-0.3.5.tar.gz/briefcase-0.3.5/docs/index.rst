Briefcase
=========

Briefcase is a tool for converting a Python project into a standalone
native application. It supports producing binaries for:

* macOS, as a standalone .app;
* Windows, as an MSI installer;
* Linux, as an AppImage;
* iOS, as an XCode project; and
* Android, as a Gradle project.

It is also extensible, allowing for additional platforms and installation
formats to be produced.
