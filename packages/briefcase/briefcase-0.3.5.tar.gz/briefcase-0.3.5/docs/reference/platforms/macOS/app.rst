===========
.app bundle
===========

A macOS ``.app`` bundle is a collection of directory with a specific layout,
and with some key metadata. If this structure and metadata exists, macOS treats
the folder as an executable file, giving it an icon.

``.app`` bundles can be copied around as if they are a single file. They can
also be compressed to reduce their size for transport.

Icon format
===========

``.app`` bundles use ``.icns`` format icons.

Splash Image format
===================

``.app`` bundles do not support splash screens or installer images.
