    Fixed VaultKeyManager.create_key() to consider the `length` param as bits
    instead of bytes for the key length. This was causing a discrepancy between
    keys generated by the HashiCorp Vault backend and the OpenStack Barbican
    backend. Considering `km` as an instance of a key manager, the following
    code `km.create_key(ctx, "AES", 256)` was generating a 256 bit AES key when
    Barbican is configured as the backend, but generating a 2048 bit AES key
    when Vault was configured as the backend.
