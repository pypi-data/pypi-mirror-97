    Enhance the key manager to handle requests containing the special (all
    zeros) managed object ID associated with Cinder's and Nova's legacy
    ConfKeyManager. The purpose of this feature is to help users migrate from
    the ConfKeyManager to a modern key manager such as Barbican. The feature
    works by ensuring the ConfKeyManager's all-zeros key ID continues to
    function when Barbican or Vault is the key manager.
