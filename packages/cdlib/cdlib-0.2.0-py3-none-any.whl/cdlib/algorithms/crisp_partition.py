    The Markov clustering algorithm (MCL) is based on simulation of (stochastic) flow in graphs.
    The MCL algorithm finds cluster structure in graphs by a mathematical bootstrapping procedure. The process deterministically computes (the probabilities of) random walks through the graph, and uses two operators transforming one set of probabilities into another. It does so using the language of stochastic matrices (also called Markov matrices) which capture the mathematical concept of random walks on a graph.
    The MCL algorithm simulates random walks within a graph by alternation of two operators called expansion and inflation.
