``CDlib`` is a meta-library for community discovery in complex networks: it implements algorithms, clustering fitness functions as well as visualization facilities.


``CDlib`` is designed around the ``networkx`` python library: however, when needed, it takes care to automatically convert (from and to) ``igraph`` object so to provide an abstraction on specific algorithm implementations to the final user.

``CDlib`` provides a standardized input/output facilities for several Community Discovery algorithms: whenever possible, to guarantee literature coherent results, implementations of CD algorithms are inherited from their original projects (see for instance [Infomap](https://pypi.org/project/infomap/),
[Louvain](https://github.com/taynaud/python-louvain), [Leiden](https://github.com/vtraag/leidenalg)).

The original projects embedded in `CDlib` are acknowledged on the documentation website: 
here [the complete list of the CD methods included in the library](https://cdlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bibliography.html).

Check out the official [tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/GiulioRossetti/cdlib/blob/master/docs/CDlib.ipynb) to get started!

## Installation

``CDlib`` *requires* python>=3.6.

To install the latest version of our library just download (or clone) the current project, open a terminal and run the following commands:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements_optional.txt # (Optional) this might not work in Windows systems due to C-based dependencies.
pip install .
```

Alternatively use pip:
```bash
pip install cdlib
```

### Optional Dependencies
``CDlib`` relies on a few packages calling C code (namely: ``python-igraph``, ``leidenalg``, ``angel_cd`` and ``infomap``).
The default installation will not set up such requirements since their configuration under non *nix systems is not trivial and cannot be easily automated.

Such a choice has been made to allow (even) Windows user to install the library and get access to its core functionalities. 

To made available (most of) the optional packages you can either:

- (Windows) manually install the optional packages (versions details are specified in ``requirements_optional.txt``) following the original projects guidelines, or
- (Linux/OSX) run the command:

```bash
pip install cdlib[C]
```

Such caveat will install everything that can be easily automated under Linux/OSX. 

#### (Advanced) Graph-tool
The only optional dependency that will remain unsatisfied following the previous procedures will be ``graph-tool`` (used to add SBM models). 
If you need it up and running, refer to the official [documentation](https://git.skewed.de/count0/graph-tool/wikis/installation-instructions).
