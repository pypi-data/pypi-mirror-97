"""The :py:mod:`~.parser` module reads files and parse the content according to a syntax
based on asterisks. :py:mod:`~.parser` ignores all the lines that do not start with
asterisks (up to initial spaces), and reads the content as a tree with 'level' determined
by the number of asterisks. For example:

.. code-block

   # This is a comment
   ! This is a comment too
   * This is a first level item (1)
   ** This is a second level item (2)
   ** This is another second level item (3)
   *** This is a third level item (4)
   * This is another first level item (5)

This is represented as:

.. code-block

        (1)        (5)
       |   |
      (2) (3)
           |
          (4)

These will identify all the commands and arguments that ``ciak`` has to run.

The two main functions in the file are :py:func:`~.read_asterisk_lines_from_file`, which
reads to relevant lines from a file, and :py:func:`~.prepare_commands`, which takes the
output of the previous function to prepare a list of string that are going to be
executed.
