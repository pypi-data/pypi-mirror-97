#
# * Provide a short and long description of the testcase
# * Provide a CIJ_TEST_NAME
# * source in CIJOE
# * Begin the test with "test::enter"

# The remainder is the implementation of the test itself. Notice that commands
# are prefixed with 'ssh::cmd' such that they can run on localhost or remotely
# by changing the environment and thereby point it to a different target
#
# Test status is indicated with 'test::fail' or 'test::pass'
