    The Brocade Fibre Channel Zone Manager driver was marked 'unsupported' in
    the Ussuri release because the vendor declined to support Python 3,
    whereas all OpenStack releases beginning with Ussuri support Python 3 only.

    In order to provide operators with a choice of FCZM drivers, the Cinder
    community decided to continue supporting the Brocade FCZM driver on a
    best-effort basis.  See the "Bug Fixes" section of these notes for
    changes made to allow the driver to run in a Python 3 environment.

    While the driver has been tested against the first Release Candidate for
    the cinder Victoria release, be aware that it does not have ongoing
    third-party CI.  If you choose to use the driver, the configuration
    option ``enable_unsupported_driver`` must be set to ``True`` in the
    ``fc-zone-manager`` section in cinder.conf to allow its use in this
    release.
