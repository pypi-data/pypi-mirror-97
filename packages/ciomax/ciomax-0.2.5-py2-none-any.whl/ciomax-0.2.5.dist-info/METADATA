## Changelog

### Version:0.2.5 -- 03 Mar 2021

* Scenes that used Conductor prior to this release should work fine, however we recommended to delete the ConductorStore object fromthe scene and reopen the dialog to get the latest defaults and to avoid unanticipated conflicts.
* Remove sampling flags from default kick command. [28857a0]
* Adds a drop-down menu to choose the render camera. The presubmission scripts then attach this camera to the active view so that the vrscene or ass files use if to render. [f97866c]
* Changed behaviour of the Presubmission script `Execute` button. It now runs the script, merges the results with the fully resolved submission, and displays the results in the `Preview` tab. In this way, the customer can see exactly what would be submitted. [35f551a]
* Presubmission scripts have a different return type and is not backwards compatible. They now return an object the same shape as a regular submission, which means any fields can be amended during presubmission. A concrete example is adding the `ARNOLD_PATHMAP` variable to the environment. Extra Assets and Environment work, but several fields are yet to be implemented. [d73690c]
* Adds two new validations. 1. Ensure either Vray or Artnold are the selected renderer. 2. Ensure Legacy 3d Maps Support is off when Arnold is the renderer.   [dcc77e5]
* `<timestamp>` token now has 1 second granularity as opposed to 1 minute. This helps to reduce conflicts when 2 jobs are submitted close to each other, especially if using an upload daemoin. [0e90e9a]
