Description: # CLU - Common Loop Utils
        
        This repository contains common functionality for writing ML training loops. The
        goal is to make trainings loops short and readable (but moving common tasks to
        small libraries) without removing the flexibility required for research.
        
        As this point we are not accepting contributions. Please fork the repository if
        you want to extend the libraries for your use case.
