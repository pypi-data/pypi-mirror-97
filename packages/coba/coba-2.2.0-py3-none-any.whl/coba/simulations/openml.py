    OpenmlSimulation turns labeled observations from a classification data set
    set, into interactions. For each interaction the feature set becomes the context and 
    all possible labels become the actions. Rewards for each interaction are created by 
    assigning a reward of 1 for taking the correct action (i.e., choosing the correct
    label) and a reward of 0 for taking any other action (i.e., choosing any of the
    incorrect lables).

    Remark:
        This class when created from a data set will load all data into memory. Be careful when 
        doing this if you are working with a large dataset. To reduce memory usage you can provide
        meta information upfront that will allow features to be correctly encoded while the
        dataset is being streamed instead of waiting until the end of the data to train an encoder.
