Description: # codecheck
        
        Codecheck is a tool for running various kinds of checkers on a set of source code files in parallel.
        These checks allow to find lots of issues with code very quickly on a developer's workstation,
        before running expensive build pipelines.
        
        ## Check types
        
        Codecheck supports the following check types. The check types to run on a file are determined based
        on the file type.
        
        - Python
          - Python compilation
          - Importing a file as a Python module
          - Doctest
          - Mypy static analyzer
          - Pycodestyle
          - Python unit tests. This one could be expensive if a project has a lot of unit tests.
        - Bash
          - Shellcheck
        
        ## Detecting the set of files
        
        Codecheck uses the following approaches to detect the set of files:
        
        - `git ls-files`
