    "# The Main Contracting Client\n",
    "Contracting comes with a robust client that abstracts most of the underpinnings of the smart contracting system so that it feels like regular Python. This lets you worry about your programming rather than the mechanics of the protocol. To start, create an instance of the `ContractingClient` like so. You can set the default `signer` who will then automatically be the `signer` of the subsequent function calls (or transactions, in blockchain terms).\n",
