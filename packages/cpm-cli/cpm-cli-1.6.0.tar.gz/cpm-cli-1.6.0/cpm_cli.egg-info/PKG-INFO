Description: # cpm: A modern project management tool for C/C++ projects  ![CI](https://github.com/jorsanpe/cpm/workflows/CI/badge.svg)
        
        You can find the [documentation](https://cpmbits.com/documentation/getting-started.html) in the [cpmbits website](https://cpmbits.com).
        
        ## Installation
        `pip3 install cpm-cli`
        
        CPM depends on [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and [ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) for the build process.
        
        ## Getting started
        ```
        cpm create DeathStartLaserBackend
        cd DeathStartLaserBackend
        cpm build
        ```
        
        After creating the project, the binary will be available in the project `build` directory. 
        ```
        ./build/DeathStartLaserBackend
        ```
        
        ### Manage dependencies
        CPM manages your project dependencies through CPM-Hub. In order to install a bit, declare it in the project descriptor:
        
        ```yaml
        build:
          bits:
            sqlite3: '3.32.3'
        test:
          bits:
            cest: '1.0'
        ```
        
        Then use the command line to install all dependencies.
        
        ```
        cpm install
        ```
        
        ### Run your tests
        ```
        cpm test
        ```
        
        Test sources reside in the `tests` directory. `cpm` will consider as test suites any files that match the expression
        `test_*.cpp`.
