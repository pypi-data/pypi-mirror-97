Description: My grab bag of convenience functions for files and filenames/pathnames.
        
        *Latest release 20210306*:
        * datafrom_fd: fix use-before-set of is_seekable.
        * RWFileBlockCache.put: remove assert(len(data)>0), adjust logic.
        
        ## Function `abspath_from_file(path, from_file)`
        
        Return the absolute path of `path` with respect to `from_file`,
        as one might do for an include file.
        
        ## Function `append_ndjson(arg, *a, **kw)`
        
        Append an iterable of objects to a file as newline delimited JSON.
        
        ## Class `BackedFile(ReadMixin)`
        
        A RawIOBase duck type
        which uses a backing file for initial data
        and writes new data to a front scratch file.
        
        ### Method `BackedFile.__init__(self, back_file, dirpath=None)`
        
        Initialise the BackedFile using `back_file` for the backing data.
        
        ### Method `BackedFile.__enter__(self)`
        
        BackedFile instances offer a context manager that take the lock,
        allowing synchronous use of the file
        without implementing a suite of special methods like pread/pwrite.
        
        ### Method `BackedFile.close(self)`
        
        Close the BackedFile.
        Flush contents. Close the front_file if necessary.
        
        ### Method `BackedFile.datafrom(self, offset)`
        
        Generator yielding natural chunks from the file commencing at offset.
        
        ### Method `BackedFile.seek(self, *a, **kw)`
        
        Adjust the current file pointer offset.
        
        ### Method `BackedFile.switch_back_file(self, *a, **kw)`
        
        Switch out one back file for another. Return the old back file.
        
        ### Method `BackedFile.tell(self)`
        
        Report the current file pointer offset.
        
        ### Method `BackedFile.write(self, *a, **kw)`
        
        Write data to the front_file.
        
        ## Class `BackedFile_TestMethods`
        
        Mixin for testing subclasses of BackedFile.
        Tests self.backed_fp.
        
        ### Method `BackedFile_TestMethods.test_BackedFile(self)`
        
        Test function for a BackedFile to use in unit test suites.
        
        ## Function `byteses_as_fd(bss, **kw)`
        
        Deliver the iterable of bytes `bss` as a readable file descriptor.
              Return the file descriptor.
              Any keyword arguments are passed to `CornuCopyBuffer.as_fd`.
        
              Example:
        
                   # present a passphrase for use as in input file descrptor
                   # for a subprocess
                   rfd = byteses_as_fd([(passphrase + '
        ').encode()])
        
        ## Function `common_path_prefix(*paths)`
        
        Return the common path prefix of the `paths`.
        
        Note that the common prefix of `'/a/b/c1'` and `'/a/b/c2'`
        is `'/a/b/'`, _not_ `'/a/b/c'`.
        
        Callers may find it useful to preadjust the supplied paths
        with `normpath`, `abspath` or `realpath` from `os.path`;
        see the `os.path` documentation for the various caveats
        which go with those functions.
        
        Examples:
        
            >>> # the obvious
            >>> common_path_prefix('', '')
            ''
            >>> common_path_prefix('/', '/')
            '/'
            >>> common_path_prefix('a', 'a')
            'a'
            >>> common_path_prefix('a', 'b')
            ''
            >>> # nonempty directory path prefixes end in os.sep
            >>> common_path_prefix('/', '/a')
            '/'
            >>> # identical paths include the final basename
            >>> common_path_prefix('p/a', 'p/a')
            'p/a'
            >>> # the comparison does not normalise paths
            >>> common_path_prefix('p//a', 'p//a')
            'p//a'
            >>> common_path_prefix('p//a', 'p//b')
            'p//'
            >>> common_path_prefix('p//a', 'p/a')
            'p/'
            >>> common_path_prefix('p/a', 'p/b')
            'p/'
            >>> # the comparison strips complete unequal path components
            >>> common_path_prefix('p/a1', 'p/a2')
            'p/'
            >>> common_path_prefix('p/a/b1', 'p/a/b2')
            'p/a/'
            >>> # contrast with cs.lex.common_prefix
            >>> common_prefix('abc/def', 'abc/def1')
            'abc/def'
            >>> common_path_prefix('abc/def', 'abc/def1')
            'abc/'
            >>> common_prefix('abc/def', 'abc/def1', 'abc/def2')
            'abc/def'
            >>> common_path_prefix('abc/def', 'abc/def1', 'abc/def2')
            'abc/'
        
        ## Function `compare(f1, f2, mode='rb')`
        
        Compare the contents of two file-like objects `f1` and `f2` for equality.
        
        If `f1` or `f2` is a string, open the named file using `mode`
        (default: `"rb"`).
        
        ## Function `copy_data(fpin, fpout, nbytes, rsize=None)`
        
        Copy `nbytes` of data from `fpin` to `fpout`,
        return the number of bytes copied.
        
        Parameters:
        * `nbytes`: number of bytes to copy.
          If `None`, copy until EOF.
        * `rsize`: read size, default `DEFAULT_READSIZE`.
        
        ## Function `crop_name(name, ext=None, name_max=255)`
        
        Crop a file basename so as not to exceed `name_max` in length.
        Return the original `name` if it already short enough.
        Otherwise crop `name` before the file extension
        to make it short enough.
        
        Parameters:
        * `name`: the file basename to crop
        * `ext`: optional file extension;
          the default is to infer the extension with `os.path.splitext`.
        * `name_max`: optional maximum length, default: `255`
        
        ## Function `datafrom(arg, *a, **kw)`
        
        General purpose reader for files yielding data from `offset`.
        
        *WARNING*: this function might move the file pointer.
        
        Parameters:
        * `f`: the file from which to read data;
          if a string, the file is opened with mode="rb";
          if an int, treated as an OS file descriptor;
          otherwise presumed to be a file-like object.
          If that object has a `.fileno()` method, treat that as an
          OS file descriptor and use it.
        * `offset`: starting offset for the data
        * `maxlength`: optional maximum amount of data to yield
        * `readsize`: read size, default DEFAULT_READSIZE.
        
        For file-like objects, the read1 method is used in preference
        to read if available. The file pointer is briefly moved during
        fetches.
        
        ## Function `datafrom_fd(fd, offset=None, readsize=None, aligned=True, maxlength=None)`
        
        General purpose reader for file descriptors yielding data from `offset`.
        **Note**: This does not move the file descriptor position
        **if** the file is seekable.
        
        Parameters:
        * `fd`: the file descriptor from which to read.
        * `offset`: the offset from which to read.
          If omitted, use the current file descriptor position.
        * `readsize`: the read size, default: `DEFAULT_READSIZE`
        * `aligned`: if true (the default), the first read is sized
          to align the new offset with a multiple of `readsize`.
        * `maxlength`: if specified yield no more than this many bytes of data.
        
        ## Function `file_based(*da, **dkw)`
        
        A decorator which caches a value obtained from a file.
        
        In addition to all the keyword arguments for `@cs.deco.cachedmethod`,
        this decorator also accepts the following arguments:
        * `attr_name`: the name for the associated attribute, used as
          the basis for the internal cache value attribute
        * `filename`: the filename to monitor.
          Default from the `._{attr_name}__filename` attribute.
          This value will be passed to the method as the `filename` keyword
          parameter.
        * `poll_delay`: delay between file polls, default `DEFAULT_POLL_INTERVAL`.
        * `sig_func`: signature function used to encapsulate the relevant
          information about the file; default
          cs.filestate.FileState({filename}).
        
        If the decorated function raises OSError with errno == ENOENT,
        this returns None. Other exceptions are reraised.
        
        ## Function `file_data(fp, nbytes=None, rsize=None)`
        
        Read `nbytes` of data from `fp` and yield the chunks as read.
        
        Parameters:
        * `nbytes`: number of bytes to read; if None read until EOF.
        * `rsize`: read size, default DEFAULT_READSIZE.
        
        ## Function `file_property(*da, **dkw)`
        
        A property whose value reloads if a file changes.
        
        ## Function `files_property(func)`
        
        A property whose value reloads if any of a list of files changes.
        
        Note: this is just the default mode for `make_files_property`.
        
        `func` accepts the file path and returns the new value.
        The underlying attribute name is `'_'+func.__name__`,
        the default from `make_files_property()`.
        The attribute *{attr_name}*`_lock` is a mutex controlling access to the property.
        The attributes *{attr_name}*`_filestates` and *{attr_name}*`_paths` track the
        associated file states.
        The attribute *{attr_name}*`_lastpoll` tracks the last poll time.
        
        The decorated function is passed the current list of files
        and returns the new list of files and the associated value.
        
        One example use would be a configuration file with recurive
        include operations; the inner function would parse the first
        file in the list, and the parse would accumulate this filename
        and those of any included files so that they can be monitored,
        triggering a fresh parse if one changes.
        
        Example:
        
            class C(object):
              def __init__(self):
                self._foo_path = '.foorc'
              @files_property
              def foo(self,paths):
                new_paths, result = parse(paths[0])
                return new_paths, result
        
        The load function is called on the first access and on every
        access thereafter where an associated file's `FileState` has
        changed and the time since the last successful load exceeds
        the poll_rate (1s). An attempt at avoiding races is made by
        ignoring reloads that raise exceptions and ignoring reloads
        where files that were stat()ed during the change check have
        changed state after the load.
        
        ## Function `find(path, select=None, sort_names=True)`
        
        Walk a directory tree `path`
        yielding selected paths.
        
        Note: not selecting a directory prunes all its descendants.
        
        ## Function `findup(path, test, first=False)`
        
        Test the pathname `abspath(path)` and each of its ancestors
        against the callable `test`,
        yielding paths satisfying the test.
        
        If `first` is true (default `False`)
        this function always yields exactly one value,
        either the first path satisfying the test or `None`.
        This mode supports a use such as:
        
            matched_path = next(findup(path, test, first=True))
            # post condition: matched_path will be `None` on no match
            # otherwise the first matching path
        
        ## Function `iter_fd(fd, **kw)`
        
        Iterate over data from the file descriptor `fd`.
        
        ## Function `iter_file(f, **kw)`
        
        Iterate over data from the file `f`.
        
        ## Function `lines_of(fp, partials=None)`
        
        Generator yielding lines from a file until EOF.
        Intended for file-like objects that lack a line iteration API.
        
        ## Function `lockfile(path, ext=None, poll_interval=None, timeout=None, runstate=None)`
        
        A context manager which takes and holds a lock file.
        
        Parameters:
        * `path`: the base associated with the lock file.
        * `ext`: the extension to the base used to construct the lock file name.
          Default: `'.lock'`
        * `timeout`: maximum time to wait before failing.
          Default: `None` (wait forever).
        * `poll_interval`: polling frequency when timeout is not `0`.
        * `runstate`: optional `RunState` duck instance supporting cancellation.
        
        ## Function `longpath(path, environ=None, prefixes=None)`
        
        Return `path` with prefixes and environment variables substituted.
        The converse of `shortpath()`.
        
        ## Function `make_files_property(attr_name=None, unset_object=None, poll_rate=1.0)`
        
        Construct a decorator that watches multiple associated files.
        
        Parameters:
        * `attr_name`: the underlying attribute, default: `'_'+func.__name__`
        * `unset_object`: the sentinel value for "uninitialised", default: `None`
        * `poll_rate`: how often in seconds to poll the file for changes,
          default from `DEFAULT_POLL_INTERVAL`: `1.0`
        
        The attribute *attr_name*`_lock` controls access to the property.
        The attributes *attr_name*`_filestates` and *attr_name*`_paths` track the
        associated files' state.
        The attribute *attr_name*`_lastpoll` tracks the last poll time.
        
        The decorated function is passed the current list of files
        and returns the new list of files and the associated value.
        
        One example use would be a configuration file with recursive
        include operations; the inner function would parse the first
        file in the list, and the parse would accumulate this filename
        and those of any included files so that they can be monitored,
        triggering a fresh parse if one changes.
        
        Example:
        
            class C(object):
              def __init__(self):
                self._foo_path = '.foorc'
              @files_property
              def foo(self,paths):
                new_paths, result = parse(paths[0])
                return new_paths, result
        
        The load function is called on the first access and on every
        access thereafter where an associated file's `FileState` has
        changed and the time since the last successful load exceeds
        the `poll_rate`.
        
        An attempt at avoiding races is made by
        ignoring reloads that raise exceptions and ignoring reloads
        where files that were `os.stat()`ed during the change check have
        changed state after the load.
        
        ## Function `makelockfile(path, ext=None, poll_interval=None, timeout=None, runstate=None)`
        
        Create a lockfile and return its path.
        
        The lockfile can be removed with `os.remove`.
        This is the core functionality supporting the `lockfile()`
        context manager.
        
        Parameters:
        * `path`: the base associated with the lock file,
          often the filesystem object whose access is being managed.
        * `ext`: the extension to the base used to construct the lockfile name.
          Default: ".lock"
        * `timeout`: maximum time to wait before failing.
          Default: `None` (wait forever).
          Note that zero is an accepted value
          and requires the lock to succeed on the first attempt.
        * `poll_interval`: polling frequency when timeout is not 0.
        * `runstate`: optional `RunState` duck instance supporting cancellation.
          Note that if a cancelled `RunState` is provided
          no attempt will be made to make the lockfile.
        
        ## Function `max_suffix(dirpath, pfx)`
        
        Compute the highest existing numeric suffix
        for names starting with the prefix `pfx`.
        
        This is generally used as a starting point for picking
        a new numeric suffix.
        
        ## Function `mkdirn(path, sep='')`
        
        Create a new directory named `path+sep+n`,
        where `n` exceeds any name already present.
        
        Parameters:
        * `path`: the basic directory path.
        * `sep`: a separator between `path` and `n`.
          Default: `''`
        
        ## Function `NamedTemporaryCopy(f, progress=False, progress_label=None, **kw)`
        
        A context manager yielding a temporary copy of `filename`
        as returned by `NamedTemporaryFile(**kw)`.
        
        Parameters:
        * `f`: the name of the file to copy, or an open binary file,
          or a `CornuCopyBuffer`
        * `progress`: an optional progress indicator, default `False`;
          if a `bool`, show a progress bar for the copy phase if true;
          if an `int`, show a progress bar for the copy phase
          if the file size equals or exceeds the value;
          otherwise it should be a `cs.progress.Progress` instance
        * `progress_label`: option progress bar label,
          only used if a progress bar is made
        Other keyword parameters are passed to `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile`.
        
        ## Class `NullFile`
        
        Writable file that discards its input.
        
        Note that this is _not_ an open of `os.devnull`;
        it just discards writes and is not the underlying file descriptor.
        
        ### Method `NullFile.__init__(self)`
        
        Initialise the file offset to 0.
        
        ### Method `NullFile.flush(self)`
        
        Flush buffered data to the subsystem.
        
        ### Method `NullFile.write(self, data)`
        
        Discard data, advance file offset by length of data.
        
        ## Class `Pathname(builtins.str)`
        
        Subclass of str presenting convenience properties useful for
        format strings related to file paths.
        
        ### Method `Pathname.__format__(self, fmt_spec)`
        
        Calling format(<Pathname>, fmt_spec) treat `fmt_spec` as a new style
        formatting string with a single positional parameter of `self`.
        
        ### Property `Pathname.abs`
        
        The absolute form of this Pathname.
        
        ### Property `Pathname.basename`
        
        The basename of this Pathname.
        
        ### Property `Pathname.dirname`
        
        The dirname of the Pathname.
        
        ### Property `Pathname.isabs`
        
        Whether this Pathname is an absolute Pathname.
        
        ### Property `Pathname.short`
        
        The shortened form of this Pathname.
        
        ### Method `Pathname.shorten(self, environ=None, prefixes=None)`
        
        Shorten a Pathname using ~ and ~user.
        
        ## Function `poll_file(path, old_state, reload_file, missing_ok=False)`
        
        Watch a file for modification by polling its state as obtained
        by `FileState()`.
        Call `reload_file(path)` if the state changes.
        Return `(new_state,reload_file(path))` if the file was modified
        and was unchanged (stable state) before and after the reload_file().
        Otherwise return `(None,None)`.
        
        This may raise an `OSError` if the `path` cannot be `os.stat()`ed
        and of course for any exceptions that occur calling `reload_file`.
        
        If `missing_ok` is true then a failure to `os.stat()` which
        raises `OSError` with `ENOENT` will just return `(None,None)`.
        
        ## Function `read_data(fp, nbytes, rsize=None)`
        
        Read `nbytes` of data from `fp`, return the data.
        
        Parameters:
        * `nbytes`: number of bytes to copy.
          If `None`, copy until EOF.
        * `rsize`: read size, default `DEFAULT_READSIZE`.
        
        ## Function `read_from(fp, rsize=None, tail_mode=False, tail_delay=None)`
        
        Generator to present text or data from an open file until EOF.
        
        Parameters:
        * `rsize`: read size, default: DEFAULT_READSIZE
        * `tail_mode`: if true, yield an empty chunk at EOF, allowing resumption
          if the file grows.
        
        ## Class `ReadMixin`
        
        Useful read methods to accomodate modes not necessarily available in a class.
        
        Note that this mixin presumes that the attribute `self._lock`
        is a threading.RLock like context manager.
        
        Classes using this mixin should consider overriding the default
        .datafrom method with something more efficient or direct.
        
        ### Method `ReadMixin.bufferfrom(self, offset)`
        
        Return a CornuCopyBuffer from the specified `offset`.
        
        ### Method `ReadMixin.datafrom(self, offset, readsize=None)`
        
        Yield data from the specified `offset` onward in some
        approximation of the "natural" chunk size.
        
        *NOTE*: UNLIKE the global datafrom() function, this method
        MUST NOT move the logical file position. Implementors may need
        to save and restore the file pointer within a lock around
        the I/O if they do not use a direct access method like
        os.pread.
        
        The aspiration here is to read data with only a single call
        to the underlying storage, and to return the chunks in
        natural sizes instead of some default read size.
        
        Classes using this mixin must implement this method.
        
        ### Method `ReadMixin.read(self, size=-1, offset=None, longread=False)`
        
        Read up to `size` bytes, honouring the "single system call"
        spirit unless `longread` is true.
        
        Parameters:
        * `size`: the number of bytes requested. A size of -1 requests
          all bytes to the end of the file.
        * `offset`: the starting point of the read; if None, use the
          current file position; if not None, seek to this position
          before reading, even if `size` == 0.
        * `longread`: switch from "single system call" to "as many
          as required to obtain `size` bytes"; short data will still
          be returned if the file is too short.
        
        ### Method `ReadMixin.read_n(self, n)`
        
        Read `n` bytes of data and return them.
        
        Unlike traditional file.read(), RawIOBase.read() may return short
        data, thus this workalike, which may only return short data if it
        hits EOF.
        
        ### Method `ReadMixin.readinto(self, *a, **kw)`
        
        Read data into a bytearray.
        
        ## Function `rewrite(filepath, srcf, mode='w', backup_ext=None, do_rename=False, do_diff=None, empty_ok=False, overwrite_anyway=False)`
        
        Rewrite the file `filepath` with data from the file object `srcf`.
        
        Parameters:
        * `filepath`: the name of the file to rewrite.
        * `srcf`: the source file containing the new content.
        * `mode`: the write-mode for the file, default `'w'` (for text);
          use `'wb'` for binary data.
        * `empty_ok`: if true (default `False`),
          do not raise `ValueError` if the new data are empty.
        * `overwrite_anyway`: if true (default `False`),
          skip the content check and overwrite unconditionally.
        * `backup_ext`: if a nonempty string,
          take a backup of the original at `filepath + backup_ext`.
        * `do_diff`: if not `None`, call `do_diff(filepath,tempfile)`.
        * `do_rename`: if true (default `False`),
          rename the temp file to `filepath`
          after copying the permission bits.
          Otherwise (default), copy the tempfile to `filepath`;
          this preserves the file's inode and permissions etc.
        
        ## Function `rewrite_cmgr(filepath, mode='w', **kw)`
        
        Rewrite a file, presented as a context manager.
        
        Parameters:
        * `mode`: file write mode, defaulting to "w" for text.
        
        Other keyword parameters are passed to `rewrite()`.
        
        Example:
        
            with rewrite_cmgr(pathname, do_rename=True) as f:
                ... write new content to f ...
        
        ## Class `RWFileBlockCache`
        
        A scratch file for storing data.
        
        ### Method `RWFileBlockCache.__init__(self, pathname=None, dirpath=None, suffix=None, lock=None)`
        
        Initialise the file.
        
        Parameters:
        * `pathname`: path of file. If None, create a new file with
          tempfile.mkstemp using dir=`dirpath` and unlink that file once
          opened.
        * `dirpath`: location for the file if made by mkstemp as above.
        * `lock`: an object to use as a mutex, allowing sharing with
          some outer system. A Lock will be allocated if omitted.
        
        ### Method `RWFileBlockCache.close(self)`
        
        Close the file descriptors.
        
        ### Property `RWFileBlockCache.closed`
        
        Test whether the file descriptor has been closed.
        
        ### Method `RWFileBlockCache.get(self, offset, length)`
        
        Get data from `offset` of length `length`.
        
        ### Method `RWFileBlockCache.put(self, data)`
        
        Store `data`, return offset.
        
        ## Function `saferename(oldpath, newpath)`
        
        Rename a path using `os.rename()`,
        but raise an exception if the target path already exists.
        Note: slightly racey.
        
        ## Function `scan_ndjson(arg, *a, **kw)`
        
        Read a newline delimited JSON file, yield instances of `dictclass`
        (default `dict`, otherwise a class which can be instantiated
        by `dictclass(a_dict)`).
        
        `error_list` is an optional list to accrue `(lineno,exception)` tuples
        for errors encountered during the scan.
        
        ## Function `seekable(fp)`
        
        Try to test whether a filelike object is seekable.
        
        First try the `IOBase.seekable` method, otherwise try getting a file
        descriptor from `fp.fileno` and `os.stat()`ing that,
        otherwise return `False`.
        
        ## Function `shortpath(path, environ=None, prefixes=None)`
        
        Return `path` with the first matching leading prefix replaced.
        
        Parameters:
        * `environ`: environment mapping if not os.environ
        * `prefixes`: iterable of `(prefix,subst)` to consider for replacement;
          each `prefix` is subject to environment variable
          substitution before consideration
          The default considers "$HOME/" for replacement by "~/".
        
        ## Class `Tee`
        
        An object with .write, .flush and .close methods
        which copies data to multiple output files.
        
        ### Method `Tee.__init__(self, *fps)`
        
        Initialise the Tee; any arguments are taken to be output file objects.
        
        ### Method `Tee.add(self, output)`
        
        Add a new output.
        
        ### Method `Tee.close(self)`

        ### Method `Tee.flush(self)`
        
        Flush all the outputs.
        
        ### Method `Tee.write(self, data)`
        
        Write the data to all the outputs.
        Note: does not detect or accodmodate short writes.
        
        ## Function `tee(fp, fp2)`
        
        Context manager duplicating .write and .flush from fp to fp2.
        
        ## Function `tmpdir()`
        
        Return the pathname of the default temporary directory for scratch data,
        the environment variable `$TMPDIR` or `'/tmp'`.
        
        ## Function `tmpdirn(tmp=None)`
        
        Make a new temporary directory with a numeric suffix.
        
        ## Function `trysaferename(oldpath, newpath)`
        
        A `saferename()` that returns `True` on success,
        `False` on failure.
        
        ## Class `UUIDNDJSONMapping(cs.obj.SingletonMixin,cs.mappings.LoadableMappingMixin)`
        
        A subclass of `LoadableMappingMixin` which maintains records
        from a newline delimited JSON file.
        
        ### Method `UUIDNDJSONMapping.__init__(self, filename, dictclass=<class 'cs.mappings.UUIDedDict'>, create=False)`
        
        Initialise the mapping.
        
        Parameters:
        * `filename`: the file containing the newline delimited JSON data;
          this need not yet exist
        * `dictclass`: a optional `dict` subclass to hold each record,
          default `UUIDedDict`
        * `create`: if true, ensure the file exists
          by transiently opening it for append if it is missing;
          default `False`
        
        ### Method `UUIDNDJSONMapping.append_to_mapping(self, record)`
        
        Append `record` to the backing file.
        
        ### Method `UUIDNDJSONMapping.rewrite_mapping(self)`
        
        Rewrite the backing file.
        
        Because the record updates are normally written in append mode,
        a rewrite will be required every so often.
        
        ### Method `UUIDNDJSONMapping.scan_mapping(self)`
        
        Scan the backing file, yield records.
        
        ## Function `write_ndjson(arg, *a, **kw)`
        
        Transcribe an iterable of objects to a file as newline delimited JSON.
