Description: CSIP Client 
        
        This library provides a simple, yet powerful API for communicating with CSIP Restful endpoints. It supports:
        
        * Service exploration and population of default service payloads
        * The creation of pipelines of cascading CSIP service calls representing complex workflows
        * Synchronous and asynchronous service execution 
        * Payload data upload and retrieval
        
        (requires Python 3.6)
