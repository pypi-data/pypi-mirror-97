Hello friend,

My name is Miss Ammaarah Younis from Libya. I am the only surviving child of Late Colonel Abu Bakr Younis, Libya's former defence minister killed with Late Colonel Muammar Gaddafi in Sirte, Libya.

I am writing from Libya and I have business proposal worth $60M  U.S.D which I will like you to help me claim and Invest in Your country. Presently due to the war here, i can not travel out to go and claim the money and Invest it where it is deposited in offshore country. I will like you to kindly write me at my private email (yyounisammaarah2015@gmail.com) so that I can tell you in details what you are expected to do for me and also for me to send you documents proof of the funds. I am ready to give you half of the money for your help. This will not waste your time.

I hope to hear from you soon.

Ammaarah Younis..
