## Overview

CTGAN is a collection of Deep Learning based Synthetic Data Generators for single table data, which are able to learn from real data and generate synthetic clones with high fidelity.

Currently, this library implements the **CTGAN** and **TVAE** models proposed in the [Modeling Tabular data using Conditional GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00503) paper. For more information about these models, please check out the respective user guides:
* [CTGAN User Guide](https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/ctgan.html).
* [TVAE User Guide](https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/tvae.html).

# Install

## Requirements

**CTGAN** has been developed and tested on [Python 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Install from PyPI

The recommended way to installing **CTGAN** is using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

```bash
pip install ctgan
```

This will pull and install the latest stable release from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).

## Install with conda

**CTGAN** can also be installed using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):

```bash
conda install -c sdv-dev -c pytorch -c conda-forge ctgan
```

This will pull and install the latest stable release from [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/).


# Usage Example

> :warning: **WARNING**: If you're just getting started with synthetic data, we recommend using the SDV library which provides user-friendly APIs for interacting with CTGAN. To learn more about using CTGAN through SDV, check out the user guide [here](https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/ctgan.html).

To get started with CTGAN, you should prepare your data as either a `numpy.ndarray` or a `pandas.DataFrame` object with two types of columns:

* **Continuous Columns**: can contain any numerical value.
* **Discrete Columns**: contain a finite number values, whether these are string values or not.

In this example we load the [Adult Census Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult) which is a built-in demo dataset. We then model it using the **CTGANSynthesizer** and generate a synthetic copy of it.


```python3
from ctgan import CTGANSynthesizer
from ctgan import load_demo

data = load_demo()

# Names of the columns that are discrete
discrete_columns = [
    'workclass',
    'education',
    'marital-status',
    'occupation',
    'relationship',
    'race',
    'sex',
    'native-country',
    'income'
]

ctgan = CTGANSynthesizer(epochs=10)
ctgan.fit(data, discrete_columns)

# Synthetic copy
samples = ctgan.sample(1000)
```

# History

## v0.4.0 - 2021-02-24

Maintenance relese to upgrade dependencies to ensure compatibility with the rest
of the SDV libraries.

Also add a validation on the CTGAN `condition_column` and `condition_value` inputs.

### Improvements

* Validate condition_column and condition_value - Issue [#124](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/124) by @fealho

## v0.3.1 - 2021-01-27

### Improvements

* Check discrete_columns valid before fitting - [Issue #35](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/35) by @fealho

## Bugs fixed

* ValueError: max() arg is an empty sequence - [Issue #115](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/115) by @fealho

## v0.3.0 - 2020-12-18

In this release we add a new TVAE model which was presented in the original CTGAN paper.
It also exposes more hyperparameters and moves epochs and log_frequency from fit to the constructor.

A new verbose argument has been added to optionally disable unnecessary printing, and a new hyperparameter
called `discriminator_steps` has been added to CTGAN to control the number of optimization steps performed
in the discriminator for each generator epoch.

The code has also been reorganized and cleaned up for better readability and interpretability.

Special thanks to @Baukebrenninkmeijer @fealho @leix28 @csala for the contributions!

* Add discriminator steps hyperparameter - [Issue #101](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/101) by @Baukebrenninkmeijer
* Code cleanup / Expose hyperparameters - [Issue #59](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/59) by @fealho and @leix28
* Publish to conda repo - [Issue #54](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/54) by @fealho

* Update dependencies and testing - [Issue #90](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/90) by @csala

## v0.2.2 - 2020-11-13

In this release we introduce several minor improvements to make CTGAN more versatile and
propertly support new types of data, such as categorical NaN values, as well as conditional
sampling and features to save and load models.

Additionally, the dependency ranges and python versions have been updated to support up
to date runtimes.

Many thanks @fealho @leix28 @csala @oregonpillow and @lurosenb for working on making this release possible!
