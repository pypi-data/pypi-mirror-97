# History

## v0.4.0 - 2021-02-24

Maintenance relese to upgrade dependencies to ensure compatibility with the rest
of the SDV libraries.

Also add a validation on the CTGAN `condition_column` and `condition_value` inputs.

### Improvements

* Validate condition_column and condition_value - Issue [#124](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/124) by @fealho

## v0.3.1 - 2021-01-27

### Improvements

* Check discrete_columns valid before fitting - [Issue #35](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/35) by @fealho

## Bugs fixed

* ValueError: max() arg is an empty sequence - [Issue #115](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/115) by @fealho

## v0.3.0 - 2020-12-18

In this release we add a new TVAE model which was presented in the original CTGAN paper.
It also exposes more hyperparameters and moves epochs and log_frequency from fit to the constructor.

A new verbose argument has been added to optionally disable unnecessary printing, and a new hyperparameter
called `discriminator_steps` has been added to CTGAN to control the number of optimization steps performed
in the discriminator for each generator epoch.

The code has also been reorganized and cleaned up for better readability and interpretability.

Special thanks to @Baukebrenninkmeijer @fealho @leix28 @csala for the contributions!

* Publish to conda repo - [Issue #54](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/54) by @fealho

### Bugs fixed

* Fixed NaN != NaN counting bug. - [Issue #100](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/100) by @fealho
* Update dependencies and testing - [Issue #90](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/90) by @csala

## v0.2.2 - 2020-11-13

In this release we introduce several minor improvements to make CTGAN more versatile and
propertly support new types of data, such as categorical NaN values, as well as conditional
sampling and features to save and load models.

Additionally, the dependency ranges and python versions have been updated to support up
to date runtimes.

Many thanks @fealho @leix28 @csala @oregonpillow and @lurosenb for working on making this release possible!

* Support NaN values in categorical variables - [Issue #78](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/78) by @fealho
* Sample synthetic data conditioning on a discrete column - [Issue #69](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/69) by @leix28
* Support recent versions of pandas - [Issue #57](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/57) by @csala
* Easy solution for restoring original dtypes - [Issue #26](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/26) by @oregonpillow

### Bugs fixed

* Loss to nan - [Issue #73](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/73) by @fealho
* Swapped the sklearn utils testing import statement - [Issue #53](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/53) by @lurosenb

## v0.2.1 - 2020-01-27

Minor version including changes to ensure the logs are properly printed and
the option to disable the log transformation to the discrete column frequencies.

Special thanks to @kevinykuo for the contributions!

### Issues Resolved:

* Option to sample from true data frequency instead of logged frequency - [Issue #16](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/16) by @kevinykuo
* Flush stdout buffer for epoch updates - [Issue #14](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/14) by @kevinykuo

## v0.2.0 - 2019-12-18

Reorganization of the project structure with a new Python API, new Command Line Interface
and increased data format support.

### Issues Resolved:

* Reorganize the project structure - [Issue #10](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/10) by @csala
* Move epochs to the fit method - [Issue #5](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/5) by @csala

## v0.1.0 - 2019-11-07
