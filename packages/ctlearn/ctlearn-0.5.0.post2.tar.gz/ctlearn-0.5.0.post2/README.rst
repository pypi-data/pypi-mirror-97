CTLearn is a package under active development to run deep learning models to analyze data from all major current and future arrays of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). CTLearn can load data from `CTA <https://www.cta-observatory.org/>`_ (Cherenkov Telescope Array), `FACT <https://www.isdc.unige.ch/fact/>`_\ , `H.E.S.S. <https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/HESS/>`_\ , `MAGIC <https://magic.mpp.mpg.de/>`_\ , and `VERITAS <https://veritas.sao.arizona.edu/>`_ telescopes processed using `DL1DataHandler <https://github.com/cta-observatory/dl1-data-handler>`_.

Install CTLearn
---------------

Clone Repository with Git
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Clone the CTLearn repository:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd </ctlearn/installation/path>
   git clone https://github.com/ctlearn-project/ctlearn.git

Install Package with Anaconda
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, download and install `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`_\ , or, for a minimal installation, `Miniconda <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`_. Create a new conda environment that includes all the dependencies for CTLearn:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda env create -f </installation/path>/ctlearn/environment-<MODE>.yml

where ``<MODE>`` is either 'cpu' or 'gpu' (for linux systems) or 'macos' (for macOS systems), denoting the TensorFlow version to be installed. If installing the GPU version of TensorFlow, verify that your system fulfills all the requirements `here <https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux#NVIDIARequirements>`_. Note that there is no GPU-enabled TensorFlow version for macOS yet.

Finally, install CTLearn into the new conda environment with pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda activate ctlearn

   cd <ctlearn/installation/path>/ctlearn
   pip install .

NOTE for developers: If you wish to fork/clone the repository and edit the code, install with ``pip -e``.

Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^


* Python>=3.7
* TensorFlow==1.15.3
* DL1DataHandler==0.8.3
* NumPy
* PyYAML
* Libraries used only in plotting scripts (optional)

  * Matplotlib
  * Pandas
  * Scikit-learn
  * ctaplot

Download Data
-------------

CTLearn can load and process data in the HDF5 PyTables format produced from simtel files by `DL1DataHandler <https://github.com/cta-observatory/dl1-data-handler>`_.

Configure a Run
---------------

CTLearn encourages reproducible training and prediction by keeping all run settings in a single YAML configuration file, organized into the sections listed below. The `example config file <config/example_config.yml>`_ describes every available setting and its possible values in detail.

Logging
^^^^^^^

Specify model directory to store TensorFlow checkpoints and summaries, a timestamped copy of the run configuration, and optionally a timestamped file with logging output.

Data
^^^^

Describe the dataset to use and relevant settings for loading and processing it. The parameters in this section are used to initialize a DL1DataReader, which loads the data files, maps the images from vectors to arrays, applies preprocessing, and returns the data as an iterator. Data can be loaded in three modes:


* Mono: single images of one telescope type
* Stereo: events of one telescope type
* Multi-stereo: events including multiple telescope types

Parameters in this section include telescope IDs to select, auxiliary parameters to return, pre-selection cuts, image mapping settings, and pre-processing to apply to the data. Image mapping is performed by the DL1DataReader and maps the 1D pixel vectors in the raw data into 2D images. The available mapping methods are oversampling, nearest interpolation, rebinning, bilinear interpolation and bicubic interpolation, image shifting, and axial addressing.
Pre-processing is performed using the DL1DataHandler Transform class.

Input
^^^^^

Set parameters of the TensorFlow Estimator input function that converts the loaded, processed data into tensors.

Model
^^^^^

CTLearn works with any TensorFlow model obeying the signature ``logits = model(features, params, example_description, training)`` where ``logits`` is a vector of raw (non-normalized, pre-Softmax) predictions, ``features`` is a dictionary of tensors, ``params`` is a dictionary of model parameters, ``example_description`` is a DL1DataReader example description, and ``training`` is a Boolean that's True in training mode and False in testing mode.

To use a custom model, provide in this section the directory containing a Python file that implements the model and the module name (that is, the file name minus the .py extension) and name of the model function within the module.

In addition, CTLearn includes four `models <models>`_ for gamma/hadron classification, energy and arrival direction regression. CNN-RNN and Variable Input Network perform array-level classification by feeding the output of a CNN for each telescope into either a recurrent network, or a convolutional or fully-connected network head, respectively. Single Tel and Res Net classifies single telescope images using a convolutional network and multiple residual blocks of convolutional layers, respectively. All four models are built on a simple, configurable convolutional network called Basic. In addition, three different attention mechanisms are implemented in Basic. 

The values in the data to be used as labels and lists of class names where applicable are also provided in this section.

Model Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section in its entirety is directly included as the model ``params``\ , enabling arbitrary configuration parameters to be passed to the provided model.

Training
^^^^^^^^

Set training parameters such as the training/validation split, the number of validations to run, and how often to evaluate on the validation set, as well as hyperparameters including the base learning rate and optimizer.

Prediction
^^^^^^^^^^

Specify prediction settings such as the path to write the prediction file and whether to save the labels and example identifiers along with the predictions.

TensorFlow
^^^^^^^^^^

Set whether to run TensorFlow in debug mode.

Run a Model
-----------

Run CTLearn from the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

   ctlearn myconfig.yml [--mode <MODE>] [--debug] [--log_to_file] [--random_seed <SEED>]

``--mode <MODE>``\ : Set run mode with ``<MODE>`` as ``train``\ , ``predict``\ , ``train_and_predict``\ , or ``load_only``. If not set, defaults to ``train``.

``--debug``\ : Set logging level to DEBUG.

``--log_to_file``\ : Save CTLearn logging messages to a timestamped file in the model directory instead of printing to stdout.

``--random_seed <SEED>``\ : Overwrite the random seed in the config file with ``<SEED>`` (4 digits).

Alternatively, import CTLearn as a module in a Python script:

.. code-block:: python

   import yaml
   from ctlearn.run_model import run_model

   with open('myconfig.yml', 'r') as myconfig:
     config = yaml.load(myconfig)
   run_model(config, mode='train', debug=True, log_to_file=True, multiple_runs=1)

View training progress in real time with TensorBoard: 

.. code-block:: bash

   tensorboard --logdir=/path/to/my/model_dir

Inspect Data
------------

Print dataset statistics only, without running a model:

.. code-block:: bash

   ctlearn myconfig.yml --mode load_only

Supplementary Scripts
---------------------


* **plot_classifier_values.py** Plot a histogram of gamma/hadron classification values from a CTLearn predictions file.
* **plot_roc_curves.py** Plot gamma/hadron classification ROC curves from a list of CTLearn predictions files.
* **run_multiple_configurations.py** Generate a list of configuration combinations and run a model for each, for example, to conduct a hyperparameter search or to automate training or prediction for a set of models. Parses a standard CTLearn configuration file with two additional sections for Multiple Configurations added. Has an option to resume from a specific run in case the execution is interrupted.
* **auto_configuration.py** Fill the path information specific to your computer and run this script from a folder with any number of configuration files to automatically overwrite them.
* **summarize_results.py** Run this script from the folder containing the ``runXX`` folders generated by the ``run_multiple_configurations.py`` script to generate a ``summary.csv`` file with key validation metrics after training of each run.

CTLearn Benchmarks
