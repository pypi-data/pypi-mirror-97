Colorspace
==========

Support for processing data in so-called “colorspace”, as produced by
the ABI SOLiD sequencer, was removed from Cutadapt versions newer than
1.18.

To process colorspace data, please use Cutadapt 1.18 or earlier.
That version also knows how to process ``.csfasta``/``.qual`` file
pairs.

`See also the colorspace section in the documentation for
Cutadapt 1.18 <https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/v1.18/colorspace.html>`_.
