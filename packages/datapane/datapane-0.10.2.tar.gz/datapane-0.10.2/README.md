Datapane is a Python library which makes it simple to build reports from the common objects in your data analysis, such as pandas DataFrames, plots from Python visualisation libraries, and Markdown.

Reports can be exported as standalone HTML documents, with rich components which allow data to be explored and visualisations to be used interactively.

For example, if you wanted to create a report with a table viewer and an interactive plot:

```python
import pandas as pd
import altair as alt
import datapane as dp

df = pd.read_csv('https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v7/finance/download/GOOG?period2=1585222905&interval=1mo&events=history')

chart = alt.Chart(df).encode(
    x='Date:T',
    y='Open'
).mark_line().interactive()

r = dp.Report(dp.DataTable(df), dp.Plot(chart))
r.save(path='report.html', open=True)
```

This would package a standalone HTML report such as the following, with a searchable DataTable and Plot component.

It's super simple, just login (see [here](https://docs.datapane.com/tut-getting-started#authentication)) and call the `publish` function on your report,
