          Generic abstract class representing task representing a balancing filter adjusting the number of observations to many categories and the number of observations in the category to the selected characteristic.
          This task solves the problem of unbalanced datasets or well-balanced datasets in whic the number of examples should be balanced according to various characteristics (e.g. containing numbers and text that does not contain numbers).
          The word 'category' here does not mean a category during classification task (but it can).
          The category means just an observation category (regardless of the problem being solved), for example,
          a sentence containing a given entity or a sentence without a given entity in a NER task to balance and adjust the number of sentences with a given amount to the number of passes without the given entity.
          One observation may belong to many categories, e.g. balancing the number of observations in the problem of multi-classification.
          This class must be inherited by a specialized class.

        Args:
            max_proportion_difference_category (float): Indicates the maximum difference allowed between the number of observations belonging to different categories.
                The minimum value is 1.0, which means that the number of observations in each category must be equal. (Default 1.0).
            max_proportion_difference_characteristic (float): Indicates the maximum difference allowed between the number of observations belonging to each category.
                This value can influence the number of examples in each category.
                The minimum value is 1.0, which means that the number of observations in categories for each characteristic identified by the value of str will be equal.
                Each category may have finally a different number of observations (depends on the 'max_proportion_difference_category' arg), but if the value of 'max_proportion_difference_characteristic' is 1.0, the proportion of various characteristics for each category will be equal.

                An observation can only be assigned to a categories returned by the 'determine_categories' method for the same observation.
                If the 'determine_categories' method returned more than a category, then the given observation may not belong to any category (then it is removed in the same way as in case of filtering tasks),
                or to any other category/categories returned by the 'determine_categories' method. (Default: 'selected_distribution_categories').
