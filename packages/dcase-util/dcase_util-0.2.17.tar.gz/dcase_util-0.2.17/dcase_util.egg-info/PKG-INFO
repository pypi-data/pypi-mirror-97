        A collection of utilities for Detection and Classification of Acoustic
        Scenes and Events

        This collection of utilities is for Detection and Classification of
        Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE). These utilities were originally
        created for the DCASE challenge baseline systems
        (`2016 <https://github.com/TUT-ARG/DCASE2016-baseline-system-python>`__
        & `2017 <https://github.com/TUT-ARG/DCASE2017-baseline-system>`__) and
        are bundled into a standalone library to allow their re-usage in other
        research projects.
        
        The main goal of the utilities is to streamline the research code, make
        it more readable, and easier to maintain. Most of the implemented
        utilities are related to audio datasets: handling meta data and various
        forms of other structured data, and provide standardized usage API to
        audio datasets from various sources.
