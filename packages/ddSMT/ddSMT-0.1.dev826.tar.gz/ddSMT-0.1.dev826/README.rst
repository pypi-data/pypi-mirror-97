ddSMT: delta debugging for SMT-LIBv2
====================================

ddSMT is a delta debugger for Sat Modulo Theories (SMT) benchmarks in
SMT-LIB v2 format. It serves as an input minimizer for SMT benchmarks on
which a given executable shows unexpected or faulty behavior and supports
all SMT-LIB v2 logics. For more details on the SMT-LIB v2 format see http://www.smtlib.org.

ddSMT is implemented in Python 3 and developed on a Linux OS. ddSMT requires
Python version 3.6 or later.
