    This class implements the approach described in [5] with a weight function
    based on decision tree regression. To build the tree the
    DecisionTreeRegressor from scikit-learn is used [6].

    Parameters
    ----------
    cu : {array-like of shape (n_outputs,), Number or None}, default=None
        The underage costs per unit. If None, then underage costs are one
        for each target variable
    co : {array-like of shape (n_outputs,), Number or None}, default=None
        The overage costs per unit. If None, then overage costs are one
        for each target variable
    criterion : {"mse", "friedman_mse", "mae"}, default="mse"
        The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria
        are "mse" for the mean squared error, which is equal to variance
        reduction as feature selection criterion and minimizes the L2 loss
        using the mean of each terminal node, "friedman_mse", which uses mean
        squared error with Friedman's improvement score for potential splits,
        and "mae" for the mean absolute error, which minimizes the L1 loss
        using the median of each terminal node.
    splitter : {"best", "random"}, default="best"
        The strategy used to choose the split at each node. Supported
        strategies are "best" to choose the best split and "random" to choose
        the best random split.
    max_depth : int, default=None
        The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
        all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
        min_samples_split samples.
    min_samples_split : int or float, default=2
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:
        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each split.
    min_samples_leaf : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
        A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
        least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and
        right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
        especially in regression.
        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each node.
    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
        the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.
    max_features : int, float or {"auto", "sqrt", "log2"}, default=None
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:
        - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
        - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and
          `int(max_features * n_features)` features are considered at each
          split.
        - If "auto", then `max_features=n_features`.
        - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
        - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
        - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.
        Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
        effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.
    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls the randomness of the estimator. The features are always
        randomly permuted at each split, even if ``splitter`` is set to
        ``"best"``. When ``max_features < n_features``, the algorithm will
        select ``max_features`` at random at each split before finding the best
        split among them. But the best found split may vary across different
        runs, even if ``max_features=n_features``. That is the case, if the
        improvement of the criterion is identical for several splits and one
        split has to be selected at random. To obtain a deterministic behaviour
        during fitting, ``random_state`` has to be fixed to an integer.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>` for details.
    max_leaf_nodes : int, default=None
        Grow a tree with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
        Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
        If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.
    min_impurity_decrease : float, default=0.0
        A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
        greater than or equal to this value.
        The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following::
            N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                                - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)
        where ``N`` is the total number of samples, ``N_t`` is the number of
        samples at the current node, ``N_t_L`` is the number of samples in the
        left child, and ``N_t_R`` is the number of samples in the right child.
        ``N``, ``N_t``, ``N_t_R`` and ``N_t_L`` all refer to the weighted sum,
        if ``sample_weight`` is passed.
    ccp_alpha : non-negative float, default=0.0
        Complexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning. The
        subtree with the largest cost complexity that is smaller than
        ``ccp_alpha`` will be chosen. By default, no pruning is performed. See
        :ref:`minimal_cost_complexity_pruning` for details.

    cu_ : ndarray, shape (n_outputs,)
        Validated underage costs.

        The number of features when ``fit`` is performed.
    n_outputs_ : int
        The number of outputs when ``fit`` is performed.
    n_samples_ : int
        The number of samples when ``fit`` is performed.

    Notes
    -----
    The default values for the parameters controlling the size of the trees
    (e.g. ``max_depth``, ``min_samples_leaf``, etc.) lead to fully grown and
    unpruned trees which can potentially be very large on some data sets. To
    reduce memory consumption, the complexity and size of the trees should be
    controlled by setting those parameter values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cu : {array-like of shape (n_outputs,), Number or None}, default=None
        The underage costs per unit. If None, then underage costs are one
        for each target variable
    co : {array-like of shape (n_outputs,), Number or None}, default=None
        The overage costs per unit. If None, then overage costs are one
        for each target variable
    criterion: {"mse", "friedman_mse, "mae"}, default="mse"
        The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria
        are "mse" for the mean squared error, which is equal to variance
        reduction as feature selection criterion and minimizes the L2 loss
        using the mean of each terminal node, "friedman_mse", which uses mean
        squared error with Friedman's improvement score for potential splits,
        and "mae" for the mean absolute error, which minimizes the L1 loss
        using the median of each terminal node.
    n_estimators : int, default=100
        The number of trees in the forest.
    max_depth : int, default=None
        The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
        all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
        min_samples_split samples.
    weight_function : {"w1", "w2"}, default="w1"
        Indicates how to determine the sample weights. If set to "w1" the weight
        function corresponds to the one described in [3]. If set to "w2" the
        weight function described in [5] will be used.
    min_samples_split : int or float, default=2
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:
        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each split.
    min_samples_leaf : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
        A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
        least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and
        right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
        especially in regression.
        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and

    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
        the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.
    max_features : {"auto", "sqrt", "log2"}, int or float, default="auto"
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:
        - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
        - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and
          `int(max_features * n_features)` features are considered at each
          split.
        - If "auto", then `max_features=n_features`.
        - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
        - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
        - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.
        Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
        effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.
    max_leaf_nodes : int, default=None
        Grow trees with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
        Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
        If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.
    min_impurity_decrease : float, default=0.0
        A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
        greater than or equal to this value.
        The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following::
            N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                                - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)
        where ``N`` is the total number of samples, ``N_t`` is the number of
        samples at the current node, ``N_t_L`` is the number of samples in the
        left child, and ``N_t_R`` is the number of samples in the right child.
        ``N``, ``N_t``, ``N_t_R`` and ``N_t_L`` all refer to the weighted sum,
        if ``sample_weight`` is passed.
    bootstrap : bool, default=True
        Whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees. If False, the
        whole dataset is used to build each tree.
    oob_score : bool, default=False
        whether to use out-of-bag samples to estimate
        the R^2 on unseen data.
    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of jobs to run in parallel. :meth:`fit`, :meth:`predict`,
        :meth:`decision_path` and :meth:`apply` are all parallelized over the
        trees. ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend`
        context. ``-1`` means using all processors.
    random_state : int or RandomState, default=None
        Controls both the randomness of the bootstrapping of the samples used
        when building trees (if ``bootstrap=True``) and the sampling of the
        features to consider when looking for the best split at each node
        (if ``max_features < n_features``).
    verbose : int, default=0
        Controls the verbosity when fitting and predicting.
    warm_start : bool, default=False
        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit
        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole
        new forest.
    ccp_alpha : non-negative float, default=0.0
        Complexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning. The
        subtree with the largest cost complexity that is smaller than
        ``ccp_alpha`` will be chosen. By default, no pruning is performed.
    max_samples : int or float, default=None
        If bootstrap is True, the number of samples to draw from X
        to train each base estimator.
        - If None (default), then draw `X.shape[0]` samples.
        - If int, then draw `max_samples` samples.
        - If float, then draw `max_samples * X.shape[0]` samples. Thus,
          `max_samples` should be in the interval `(0, 1)`.

    Notes
    -----
    The default values for the parameters controlling the size of the trees
    (e.g. ``max_depth``, ``min_samples_leaf``, etc.) lead to fully grown and
    unpruned trees which can potentially be very large on some data sets. To
    reduce memory consumption, the complexity and size of the trees should be
    controlled by setting those parameter values.
    The features are always randomly permuted at each split. Therefore,
    the best found split may vary, even with the same training data,
    ``max_features=n_features`` and ``bootstrap=False``, if the improvement
    of the criterion is identical for several splits enumerated during the
    search of the best split. To obtain a deterministic behaviour during
    fitting, ``random_state`` has to be fixed.

    This class implements the approach described in [3] with a weight function
    based k-nearest-neighbor regression. To determine the k-nearest-neighbors
    NearestNeighbors from scikit-learn is used [4].

    Parameters
    ----------
    cu : {array-like of shape (n_outputs,), Number or None}, default=None
        The underage costs per unit. If None, then underage costs are one
        for each target variable
    co : {array-like of shape (n_outputs,), Number or None}, default=None
        The overage costs per unit. If None, then overage costs are one
        for each target variable
    n_neighbors : int, default=5
        Number of neighbors to use by default for :meth:`kneighbors` queries.
    radius : float, default=1.0
        Range of parameter space to use by default for :meth:`radius_neighbors`
        queries.
    algorithm : {'auto', 'ball_tree', 'kd_tree', 'brute'}, default='auto'
        Algorithm used to compute the nearest neighbors:
        - 'ball_tree' will use :class:`BallTree`
        - 'kd_tree' will use :class:`KDTree`
        - 'brute' will use a brute-force search.
        - 'auto' will attempt to decide the most appropriate algorithm
          based on the values passed to :meth:`fit` method.
        Note: fitting on sparse input will override the setting of
        this parameter, using brute force.
    leaf_size : int, default=30
        Leaf size passed to BallTree or KDTree.  This can affect the
        speed of the construction and query, as well as the memory
        required to store the tree.  The optimal value depends on the
        nature of the problem.
    metric : str or callable, default='minkowski'
        the distance metric to use for the tree.  The default metric is
        minkowski, and with p=2 is equivalent to the standard Euclidean
        metric. See the documentation of :class:`DistanceMetric` for a
        list of available metrics.
        If metric is "precomputed", X is assumed to be a distance matrix and
        must be square during fit. X may be a :term:`sparse graph`,
        in which case only "nonzero" elements may be considered neighbors.
    p : int, default=2
        Parameter for the Minkowski metric from
        sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances. When p = 1, this is
        equivalent to using manhattan_distance (l1), and euclidean_distance
        (l2) for p = 2. For arbitrary p, minkowski_distance (l_p) is used.
    metric_params : dict, default=None
        Additional keyword arguments for the metric function.
    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of parallel jobs to run for neighbors search.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors.

    y_ : array of shape (n_samples, n_outputs)

    co_ : ndarray, shape (n_outputs,)
