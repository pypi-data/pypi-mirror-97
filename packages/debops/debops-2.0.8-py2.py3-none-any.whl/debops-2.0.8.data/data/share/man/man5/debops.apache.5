You can use Ansible \fB\-\-tags\fP or \fB\-\-skip\-tags\fP parameters to limit what
tasks are performed during Ansible run. This can be used after a host was first

the environment for other dependency roles to work correctly.

.SS apache__modules
.sp
The Apache modules configuration is represented as YAML dictionaries. Each key of
those dictionaries is a module name.
The module names correspond to the file names under \fB/etc/apache2/mods\-available\fP
Refer to the \fI\%Apache module index\fP <\fBhttps://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/\fP> for a full list of available modules upstream.
.sp
The role provides multiple variables which can be used on different inventory
levels. The \fBapache__combined_modules\fP variable combines these YAML
dictionaries together and determines the order in which module configuration
"mask" the previous onces.
.sp
The dictionary value can be a simple boolean corresponding to the \fBenabled\fP
option (as described below) or a dictionary by itself with the following
supported options:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBenabled\fP
Required, boolean. Defaults to \fBTrue\fP\&.
Set to \fB{{ omit }}\fP not change the state of a module.
Whether the module should be enabled or disabled in Apache.
.TP
.B \fBforce\fP
Optional, boolean. Defaults to \fBFalse\fP\&.
Force disabling of default modules and override Debian warnings when set to \fBTrue\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBconfig\fP
Optional, string.
Module configuration directives which will be saved in a role managed
configuration file under \fBconf\-available\fP and contained in a
\fB<IfModule>\fP section which causes Apache to only enables this module
configuration when the module is enabled.
.TP
.B \fBignore_configcheck\fP
Optional, boolean. Defaults to \fBFalse\fP\&.
Ignore configuration checks about inconsistent module configuration.
Especially for mpm_* modules.

.SS apache__snippets
.sp
Apache configuration snippets are represented as YAML dictionaries. Each key of those
dictionaries corresponds to the filename prefix under \fBconf\-available\fP\&.
The \fB\&.conf\fP file extension is added by the role and must be omitted by
the user.
Note that Debian maintainers recommend in \fBREADME.Debian\fP of the
\fBapache2\fP package that filenames should be prefixed with \fBlocal\-\fP to
avoid name clashes with files installed by packages. This is not enforced by
the role and should be done by the user of the role.
.sp
The role provides multiple variables which can be used on different inventory
levels. The \fBapache__combined_snippets\fP variable combines these YAML
dictionaries together and determine the order in which configuration
"mask" the previous onces.
.sp
The dictionary value can be a simple boolean corresponding to the \fBenabled\fP
option (as described below) or a dictionary by itself with the following
supported options:
.INDENT 0.0

Refer to the following subsections for the supported type.
.UNINDENT
.SS Type: raw
.sp
Available when \fBitem.type\fP is set to \fBraw\fP or \fBdivert\fP\&.
This can be used to create a snippet based on the \fBitem.raw\fP content.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBraw\fP
Optional, string.
Raw content to write into the snippet file.
By default, the role will look under
\fBtemplates/etc/apache2/conf\-available\fP for a template matching the item
key.
If \fBraw\fP is specified, a special template will be used which simply
writes the given content into the snippet.
Refer to the \fI\%Apache configuration sections documentation\fP <\fBhttps://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/sections.html\fP> for details.
.UNINDENT
.SS Type: divert
.sp
Available when \fBitem.type\fP is set to \fBdivert\fP\&.
This special type does not create a snippet file, instead it uses
\fBdpkg\-divert\fP to allow you to do a package management aware rename of a snippet.
.sp
Note that for this type no changes are done in the \fBconf\-enabled\fP
directory to avoid idempotency issues with a potential snippet with the
same filename as the snippet which is diverted away.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBdivert_suffix\fP
Optional, string. Defaults to \fB\&.dpkg\-divert\fP\&.
Allows to change the suffix for the diverted file in the

.TP
.B \fBdivert\fP
Optional, string. Defaults to the file path determined for snippet in the
\fBconf\-available\fP directory.
Allows to specify a full file path where to divert the file to.
Note that the \fBitem.divert_suffix\fP is still in affect when using this option.
.UNINDENT
.SS Type: dont\-create

This special type assumes the snippet file is already present and does not try
to create it.
This can be used to enable or disable snippet files managed by system packages
for example.

Most variables which directly correspond to a Apache directive are not masked
or otherwise changed (for example using \fBTrue\fP, \fBFalse\fP for directives
which expect \fBon\fP, \fBoff\fP is \fInot\fP supported).
Together with the direct reference to upstream documentation provided in the
role documentation this is expected to provide more transparency to the user
and allow the role to be future proof when changes occur upstream.
.IP \(bu 2
For directives where \fBoff\fP or \fBFalse\fP might be a valid option, the
special variable \fBomit\fP (use in Jinja: \fB{{ omit }}\fP) is intended to be
used when the directive should be omitted (not written to the Apache
configuration at all).

Apache is not restarted by the role because that would require to close
established connections. Some configuration options require a restart to take
effect. The documentation for those options should give a hint about it. You
should test your settings with a test system and do a restart in production
manually when required.
Optionally, it should be possible to allow restarts using inventory variables.

\fI\%Ansible Galaxy\fP <\fBhttps://galaxy.ansible.com/\fP> has an impressive number of
Ansible roles for Apache at your disposal. A few of them have been checked out
before/while writing this role:

However, none of the already existing roles where found to be a suitable start for
Apache support in DebOps so this role has been designed and written from scratch.
Unfortunately, that workflow is not uncommon considering the quality requirements and standards of DebOps.
