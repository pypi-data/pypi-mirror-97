.sp
The \fBdebops.core\fP Ansible role takes care of variables that are shared among
different roles and are useful to keep in a central location. This is done by
leveraging functionality of \fI\%Ansible local facts\fP <\fBhttps://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_variables.html#local-facts-facts-d\fP> stored on remote hosts to
ensure that the variables are always evaluated by Ansible, even when playbook
is run with or without different sets of role tags.
.SH GETTING STARTED
.SS Initial configuration
.sp
By default \fBdebops.core\fP is run from its own \fBcore.yml\fP DebOps playbook by
the \fBcommon.yml\fP playbook, which means that it is run on all hosts in the
inventory.
.sp
If you want to modify the "root path" variables (\fBcore__root_*\fP), it\(aqs best to
prepare the new ones before initial configuration (for example in a test
environment), so that you won\(aqt need to change them after everything is
configured.
.sp
To see what facts are configured on a host, run command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
user@host:~$ ansible <hostname> \-b \-m setup \-a \(aqfilter=ansible_local\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Ansible Controller IP addresses
.sp
The \fBdebops.core\fP role gathers information about the IP address(es) from which the
Ansible Controller host is connecting from using the \fB$SSH_CLIENT\fP environment
variable on the remote host.
.sp
The list of Ansible Controller IP addresses is accessible as
\fBansible_local.core.ansible_controllers\fP for other roles to use as
needed.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
For the IP address gathering to work correctly, you shouldn\(aqt specify
\fBbecome\fP parameters in the Ansible inventory. In that case the playbook or
task level setting won\(aqt be able to override the inventory setting and the
IP address will be inaccessible to Ansible.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Example playbook
.sp
To get information about the IP address of the Ansible Controller,
\fBdebops.core\fP needs to be run from special playbook, which does not switch to
privileged mode by default, but the role within it does. That way, the role has
access to the environment variables of the unprivileged account Ansible is
connecting through and can read the \fB$SSH_CLIENT\fP environment variable and
get the IP address.
.sp
Note: Hosts provisioned by the \fBbootstrap\fP playbook have a workaround in
place so that the playbook could be run in privileged mode but to avoid
problems with \fI\%other provisioning methods\fP <\fBhttps://github.com/debops/ansible-core/issues/6#issuecomment-141923939\fP>
the role should be run in unprivileged mode as mentioned.
.sp
This is a playbook that is used to run the role:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-\-\-

\- name: Prepare core environment
  collections: [ \(aqdebops.debops\(aq, \(aqdebops.roles01\(aq,

      become: True

.ft P

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you use your own set of custom playbooks, you can either copy the above
playbook, or, if you have the DebOps playbooks installed in the default location,
include the \fBcore.yml\fP playbook in your common playbook (it is sufficient to
run it only once at the start of the playbook):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-\-\-

\- include: ~/.local/share/debops/debops\-playbooks/playbooks/core.yml

  hosts: \(aqdebops_all_hosts\(aq
  become: True

  roles:

    \- role: example\-role
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you use the default DebOps playbooks alongside your own custom ones, you don\(aqt
need to include the \fBcore.yml\fP playbook at all.
.sp
See the usage guide in the \fBdebops.core\fP documentation for information about
its use.
.SH USAGE GUIDES
.SS Design of global variables in DebOps
.sp
When Ansible playbooks are designed to be read\-only, to be able to get the
updated versions, Ansible does not have good support for variables that are
supposed to be accessed by different roles at any point. The issues arise when
the user starts to use \fB\-\-tags\fP or \fB\-\-skip\-tags\fP parameters to selectively run
parts of playbooks or roles – Ansible does not evaluate variables from roles that
weren\(aqt included, which can change the environment and break the idempotency.
.sp
The solution to use the \fBgroup_vars/all/\fP directory in the playbook directory
doesn\(aqt work, because variables defined there cannot be overwritten by Ansible
inventory, thereby they cannot be changed as needed by the user. A separate
Ansible role could be used with variables defined in it\(aqs
\fBdefaults/main.yml\fP, but it would need to be a dependency of all the roles
that used these variables, so virtually all roles would need to use it for
consistency.
.sp
A different solution, which is implemented by the \fBdebops.core\fP role, is to use
Ansible local facts defined on the remote hosts themselves as a data store for
variables that are meant to be visible to all roles at all times. Ansible
gathers these facts on any playbook execution and they are accessible from
anywhere in the playbook or roles.
.sp
To make the configuration easier to modify by the user, values for these local
facts are derived from \fBdebops.core\fP default variables, which means that the user
can redefine them in the Ansible inventory. For consistency and idempotency
this role will take care to use existing values even if their definitions are
removed from the inventory.
.sp
By moving the variables to the remote host itself, \fBdebops.core\fP does not need to
be included in all other roles as a dependency, and it can be simply executed
once at the start of the playbook. To resolve issues with missing dict keys
during Ansible runs, \fBdebops.core\fP is "artificially required" by all other
DebOps roles. If the main DebOps playbook is used, this doesn\(aqt change
anything, but if roles are used separately, or from a custom playbook,
the \fBdebops.core\fP role should be included at the start, preferably in a separate
play to make sure that Ansible re\-gathers the local facts after the role has
configured them.
.sp
To make the local facts consistent and managed centrally, \fBdebops.core\fP
provides a custom set of fact scripts which are used to dynamically gather
certain facts about a given host. Any new custom fact scripts which is
independent of a specific role, will be included in this one.
.SS Custom local facts
.sp
The \fBdebops.core\fP role allows the user to specify custom variables which will be
configured in the Ansible local facts on a given host. Three levels of
variables that can be used:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBcore__facts\fP
Dictionary which should be defined in the \fBinventory/group_vars/all/\fP
group which applies to all hosts in the inventory.
.TP
.B \fBcore__group_facts\fP
Dictionary which should be defined in the \fBinventory/group_vars/*/\fP
group to set variables on specific sets of hosts. Only one group level is
supported.
.TP
.B \fBcore__host_facts\fP
Dictionary which should be defined in \fBinventory/host_vars/*/\fP
for a particular host.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The key specifies the name of a variable in the \fBansible_local.core.*\fP namespace, with
value being it\(aqs value. You can use normal YAML variables as values, even lists
and dictionaries.
.sp
All variables defined in the inventory will be merged in one namespace, more
specific variables overriding the less specific ones (global \-> group \-> host).
.sp
The role takes care to reuse already set local facts even if their definition
has been removed from the inventory, however changes in the inventory will override
local facts. It\(aqs best not to change already defined variables like file and
directory paths, because that might break already configured software if the
involved directories/files are not taken care of.
.sp
Additional variables can be used to manipulate facts defined on remote hosts:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBcore__remove_facts\fP
List of fact names in \fBansible_local.core.*\fP which will be
removed if found.
.TP
.B \fBcore__reset_facts\fP
Boolean. If set to \fBTrue\fP, \fBdebops.core\fP role will ignore facts already
defined on remote hosts and recreate the \fBansible_local.core.*\fP namespace
using only facts defined in Ansible inventory.
.UNINDENT
.SS Examples
.sp
Create a set of custom facts:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
core__facts:
  \(aqfact_name\(aq: \(aqfact_value\(aq
  \(aqextra_list\(aq: [ \(aqlist\(aq, \(aqof\(aq, \(aqvalues\(aq ]
  \(aqnested_dict\(aq:
    \(aqsome_key\(aq: \(aqsome_value\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When above variables are defined they can be accessed using Jinja variables:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
fact_name: \(aq{{ ansible_local.core.fact_name }}\(aq
extra_list: \(aq{{ ansible_local.core.extra_list | join(" ") }}\(aq
nested_dict: \(aq{{ ansible_local.core.nested_dict.some_key }}\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Above code will work correctly if \fBdebops.core\fP has been executed previously
on a host. If you want your role to be compatible with installations that don\(aqt
use it, you need to write your variable like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
var: \(aq{{ ansible_local.core.fact_name
         if (ansible_local|d() and ansible_local.core|d() and
             ansible_local.core.fact_name|d())
         else "fact_value" }}\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
That way Ansible won\(aqt emit an error about missing dictionary keys at each
level of the \fBansible_local\fP variable namespace.
.SS Custom host tags
.sp
"Host tags" work similar to custom local facts. The difference is that this is
only a single list of items, merged from separate variables on all levels of
the inventory. You can set host tags using the variables:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBcore__tags\fP
Global list of tags, should be defined in \fBinventory/group_vars/all/\fP
.TP
.B \fBcore__group_tags\fP
List of tags for a specific group, should be defined in
\fBinventory/group_vars/*/\fP
.TP
.B \fBcore__host_tags\fP
List of tags for a specific host, should be defined in
\fBinventory/host_vars/*/\fP
.TP
.B \fBcore__static_tags\fP
Any list specified here will override already defined tags.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Tags can be accessed using the \fBansible_local.tags\fP list variable. Other roles
can check if a given item is or is not present in this global list and perform
actions depending on that state.
.SS Examples
.sp
Check if a given value is in the tag list:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\- name: Show debug output
  debug: msg="Test"
  when: ansible_local|d() and ansible_local.tags|d() and
        \(aqvalue\(aq in ansible_local.tags
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Check if a given value is not in the tag list:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\- name: Show debug output
  debug: msg="Test"
  when: ansible_local|d() and ansible_local.tags|d() and
        \(aqvalue\(aq not in ansible_local.tags
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can find a list of host tags in the documentation of various roles which use
them.
.SS System administrator accounts
.sp
Common feature in various services is creation of an administrator account. The
\fBdebops.core\fP role provides two Ansible local facts which can be used by
other roles to make creation of these accounts easier.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBansible_local.core.admin_groups\fP
List of the UNIX system groups which contains system administrator accounts.
.TP
.B \fBansible_local.core.admin_users\fP
List of the UNIX user accounts which are members of the above UNIX groups.
These accounts should be used by the other Ansible roles to create
administrator accounts if none were set by the user through the Ansible
inventory.
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can use the corresponding role default variables to control what admin
accounts are available to other roles.
.SS Examples
.sp
Define list of admin accounts to create in the application:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
application__admins: \(aq{{ ansible_local.core.admin_users
                         if (ansible_local|d() and ansible_local.core|d() and
                             ansible_local.core.admin_users|d())
                         else [] }}\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Root directory paths
.sp
Playbooks and roles that install custom software can use different paths for
various types of files: binaries, static data, variable data, and so on. These
paths are commonly shared among various software on a UNIX\-like operating
system. Because switching the paths on many roles at once can become tedious,
the "root path" variables exist to define common directories that can be used by
roles. Using these, you can easily change where the various application files
are stored, without the need to modify the roles themselves.
.sp
It is advisable to set the root paths once and not change them through the
lifetime of a given host, due to the fact that these variables are internal
Ansible variables, and not "live" application variables – if you change them
after the system is configured, and reconfigure it using Ansible with new
information, some files might need to be moved to the new location manually
(for example compiled binaries or generated data), otherwise applications might
not find these files in the new location.
.sp
You can specify various root paths using the \fBcore__root_*\fP variables found in
the \fBdefaults/main.yml\fP\&. They are accessible in the roles and playbooks in
the \fBansible_local.root.*\fP variable namespace.
.SS Examples
.sp
Create an user account with home directory using root paths assuming that the
\fBdebops.core\fP role has been run on the host previously:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\- name: Create new user
  user:
    name: \(aq{{ username }}\(aq
    state: \(aqpresent\(aq
    home: \(aq{{ ansible_local.root.home + "/" + username }}\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you want to support the case without the \fBdebops.core\fP role present, you
can do it like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\- name: Create new user
  user:
    name: \(aq{{ username }}\(aq
    state: \(aqpresent\(aq
    home: \(aq{{ (ansible_local.root.home
               if (ansible_local|d() and ansible_local.root|d() and
                   ansible_local.root.home|d())
               else "/home") + "/" + username }}\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will allow you to set the path for common home directories in one location
and reuse it through your infrastructure.
.SS Custom distribution and release facts
.sp
Ansible sometimes detects the installed OS distribution and release
incorrectly. For example, current Debian Testing release is not detected at
all, and the \fBansible_distribution_release\fP variable is set to \fBNA\fP which,
if used in the roles, can break a lot of existing configuration.
.sp
The \fBdebops.core\fP role provides alternative set of the
\fBansible_distribution\fP and \fBansible_distribution_release\fP variables through
Ansible local facts, accessible as \fBansible_local.core.distribution\fP and
\fBansible_local.core.distribution_release\fP\&. They use the original Ansible
facts if they are not \fBNA\fP and refer to the \fBansible_lsb\fP otherwise; they
can also be overridden through Ansible inventory. By using these local facts in
your roles, you can have a centralized place to control these facts if
necessary.
.SS Examples
.sp
In your role default variables, create separate variables that hold the
information about current distribution and release:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
application__distribution: \(aq{{ ansible_local.core.distribution
                               if (ansible_local|d() and ansible_local.core|d() and
                                   ansible_local.core.distribution|d())
                               else ansible_distribution }}\(aq

application__distribution_release: \(aq{{ ansible_local.core.distribution_release
                                       if (ansible_local|d() and ansible_local.core|d() and
                                           ansible_local.core.distribution_release|d())
                                       else ansible_distribution_release }}\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Global unsafe writes
.sp
Many Ansible modules related to file operations support the \fBunsafe_writes\fP
parameter to allow operations that might be dangerous or destructive in certain
conditions, but allow Ansible to work in specific environments, like
bind\-mounted files or directories. The \fBcore__unsafe_writes\fP default
variable allows to activate this mode per\-host using Ansible inventory, for all
roles that implement it.
.sp
To have an effect, roles that depend on the unsafe writes to function, should
use the parameter in relevant tasks, like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\- name: Generate configuration file
  template:
    src: \(aqetc/application.conf.j2\(aq
    dest: \(aq/etc/application.conf\(aq
    owner: \(aqroot\(aq
    group: \(aqroot\(aq
    mode: \(aq0644\(aq
    unsafe_writes: \(aq{{ True if (core__unsafe_writes|d(True if (ansible_local|d() and ansible_local.core|d()
                       and ansible_local.core.unsafe_writes|d() | bool) else False) | bool) else omit }}\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that the way \fBcore__unsafe_writes\fP is checked and takes precedence
even from the context of another role is not otherwise done in DebOps.
This was done in this case to allow to only enable
\fBcore__unsafe_writes\fP when necessary without the need to run the
\fBdebops.core\fP role first and ensuring that it’s facts are made persistent as well.
.SS List of current POSIX capabilities
.sp
\fI\%POSIX Capabilities\fP <\fBhttp://www.linuxjournal.com/magazine/making-root-unprivileged\fP> are a way to
control access to system files and resources by a particular process, for
example the ability to create or remove network interfaces, control the
\fBnetfilter\fP firewall, mount filesystems, and so on.
.sp
On regular Linux hosts, capabilities are usually not set or very broad and don\(aqt
hinder Ansible at all. This changes in more controlled environments, like Linux
Containers, Docker containers or similar environments. In there, a local
\fBroot\fP account can be blocked by a host system from accessing the network
stack or mounting filesystems, in which case Ansible usually returns an error.
.sp
To avoid this issue, \fBdebops.core\fP provides a Bash script which gathers
a list of currently present POSIX capabilities and presents them as Ansible
facts. Using these, playbooks and roles can check if a particular capability is
present and avoid execution of a set of tasks if they cannot be performed
safely.
.sp
The list of POSIX capabilities is available in the \fBansible_local.cap12s.list\fP
variable. To check if POSIX capabilities are enabled at all (the list is
unreliable for this check), you can use the \fBansible_local.cap12s.enabled\fP
boolean variable.
.SS Examples
.sp
Reconfigure the firewall if the system capabilities allow it:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\- name: Configure the firewall
  service:
    name: \(aqferm\(aq
    state: \(aqrestarted\(aq
  when: (ansible_local|d() and ansible_local.cap12s|d() and
         (not ansible_local.cap12s.enabled | bool or
         (ansible_local.cap12s.enabled | bool and
          \(aqcap_net_admin\(aq in ansible_local.cap12s.list)))
