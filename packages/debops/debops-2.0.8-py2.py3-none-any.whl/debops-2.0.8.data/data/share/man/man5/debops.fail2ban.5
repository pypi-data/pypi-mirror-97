\fI\%fail2ban\fP <\fBhttp://www.fail2ban.org/\fP> is a service which parses specified log files and can perform
configured actions when a given \fI\%regexp\fP <\fBhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression\fP> is found. It\(aqs usually used to ban
offending IP addresses using \fBiptables\fP rules (only IPv4 connections are
supported at the moment).
.SH GETTING STARTED
.sp
When \fBfail2ban\fP is installed, an \fBssh\fP jail will be configured by default
(by the Debian package, not DebOps).
.sp
\fBdebops.fail2ban\fP role uses \fBiptables\fP \fBrecent\fP module instead of adding
the banned hosts to the firewall directly. The \fBrecent\fP rule will be added to
the \fBINPUT\fP chain at specific location, to work seamlessly with the default
firewall configuration managed by \fBdebops.ferm\fP role. If necessary, you can
specify the location of the rules using custom \fBitem.position\fP parameter.
.SS Example inventory
.sp
To enable \fBfail2ban\fP you can add a host or several hosts to
\fB[debops_service_fail2ban]\fP group:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[debops_service_fail2ban]
hostname
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you have many hosts which you want to protect using \fBfail2ban\fP, you can
instead create a child group and add it to the \fB[debops_service_fail2ban]\fP parent
group:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[debops_service_fail2ban:children]
protected_hosts

[protected_hosts]
host1
host2
host3
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To manage jails, you use \fBfail2ban_*_jails\fP list variables by adding them in
\fBgroup_vars/\fP or \fBhost_vars/\fP directories. For example, to disable the
\fBssh\fP jail by default on all hosts, create
\fBinventory/group_vars/all/fail2ban.yml\fP file and add inside:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C

.SH DEFAULT VARIABLES: CONFIGURATION
.sp
some of \fBdebops.fail2ban\fP default variables have more extensive configuration
than simple strings or lists, here you can find documentation and examples for
them.
.SS fail2ban_actions
.sp
List of local \fBfail2ban\fP actions that should be present or absent when configuring
\fBfail2ban\fP\&. Each action is defined as a YAML dict with the following keys:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBname\fP
Required. Name of the filter.
.TP
.B \fBban\fP
Required. Command executed when banning an IP. Take care that the command is executed
with \fBfail2ban\fP user rights.
.TP
.B \fBcheck\fP
Optional. Command executed once before each \fBban\fP command.
.TP
.B \fBfilename\fP
Optional. Alternative name of the action configuration file.
.TP
.B \fBstart\fP
Optional. Command executed once at the start of \fBfail2ban\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBstate\fP
Optional. If \fBpresent\fP, the action will be created when configuring \fBfail2ban\fP\&.
If \fBabsent\fP, the action will be removed when configuring \fBfail2ban\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBstop\fP
Optional. Command executed once at the end of \fBfail2ban\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBunban\fP
Optional. Command executed when unbanning an IP. Take care that the command is executed
with \fBfail2ban\fP user rights.
.UNINDENT
.SS fail2ban_filters
.sp
List of local \fBfail2ban\fP filters that should be present or absent when configuring
\fBfail2ban\fP\&. Each filter is defined as a YAML dict with the following keys:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBname\fP
Required. Name of the filter.
.TP
.B \fBafter\fP
Optional. Specify an additional filter configuration file that \fBfail2ban\fP will
read after reading this filter configuration filer.
.TP
.B \fBbefore\fP
Optional. Specify an additional filter configuration file that \fBfail2ban\fP will
read before reading this filter configuration file.
.TP
.B \fBdefinitions\fP
Optional. Custom definitions used by the filter.
.TP
.B \fBfailregex\fP
Required. A string of regular expression(s) used by the filter to detect
break\-in attempts. You can have the filter try to match multiple regular
expressions by using the \fB|\fP character (the YAML literal style operator). Each
regular expression should be on its own line. Refer to the \fI\%examples\fP section.
.TP
.B \fBfilename\fP
Optional. Alternative name of the filter configuration file. If not specified, it
will use the \fBname\fP of the filter.
.TP
.B \fBignoreregex\fP
Optional. Regular expression(s) used to filter out invalid break\-in attempts. You
can have the filter try to match multiple regular expressions. Each regular
expression should be on its own line.
.TP
.B \fBstate\fP
Optional. If \fBpresent\fP, the filter will be created when configuring \fBfail2ban\fP\&.
If \fBabsent\fP, the filter will be removed when configuring \fBfail2ban\fP\&.

Refer to the \fBfail2ban\fP \fI\%filter wiki\fP <\fBhttps://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/MANUAL_0_8#Filters\fP> for more information.
.SS fail2ban_jails
.sp
Jails are defined in the form of dicts, where dict keys are the option names
and dict values are option values. You can specify values either as strings or
YAML lists, in which case elements of the list will be separated by commas.
.sp
Some keys have a special meaning:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBname\fP
Jail name, used as a section header and part of the filename. Required.
.TP
.B \fBfilename\fP
Alternative file name, optional.
.TP
.B \fBcomment\fP
A commented text added before the given jail
.TP
.B \fBdelete\fP

be deleted
.TP
.B \fBignoreip\fP
\fBList\fP of IP addresses or CIDR subnets which should be ignored by
\fBfail2ban\fP
.TP
.B \fBaction\fP
It should be a name of a default or custom action, which will be used by
\fBfail2ban\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
Other options are the same as normal \fBfail2ban\fP jail configuration options.
Refer to default \fB/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf\fP or \fI\%fail2ban wiki\fP <\fBhttp://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/MANUAL_0_8#Jails\fP> for possible
options.
