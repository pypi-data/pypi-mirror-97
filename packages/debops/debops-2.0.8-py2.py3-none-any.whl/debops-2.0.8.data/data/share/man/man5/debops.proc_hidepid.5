.sp
This role will ensure that the \fB/proc\fP filesystem is mounted with the
\fBhidepid=\fP option enabled. \fI\%The \(aqhidepid=\(aq option\fP <\fBhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Security#hidepid\fP> can be used to hide
processes that don\(aqt belong to a particular user account.
.SH GETTING STARTED
.SS Static GID assignment
.sp
The \fBprocadmins\fP group uses a static GID \fB70\fP, chosen based on the default
set of system groups provided in Debian with usable range between 61\-99. This
becomes important in environments with LXC containers where, depending on the
configuration, host and container GIDs could differ, resulting in a different
set of users being able to see the \fB/proc\fP contents. Thus, the need to
synchronize the GID between distinct environments sharing the same GID
namespace (the same kernel).
.SS Ansible local facts
.sp
The \fBdebops.proc_hidepid\fP role provides a set of Ansible local facts
available in the \fBansible_local.proc_hidepid.*\fP hierarchy. You can use the
facts to add application UNIX accounts to the correct UNIX system group that
allows them access to the \fB/proc\fP filesystem.
.SS Example inventory
.sp
The \fBdebops.proc_hidepid\fP role is included by default in the \fBcommon.yml\fP
DebOps playbook; you don\(aqt need to add hosts to any Ansible groups to enable
it.
.SS Example playbook
.sp
If you are using this role without DebOps, here\(aqs an example Ansible playbook
that uses the \fBdebops.proc_hidepid\fP role:

.SS Ansible tags
.sp
You can use Ansible \fB\-\-tags\fP or \fB\-\-skip\-tags\fP parameters to limit what
tasks are performed during Ansible run. This can be used after a host was first
configured to speed up playbook execution, when you are sure that most of the
configuration is already in the desired state.
.sp
Available role tags:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBrole::proc_hidepid\fP
Main role tag, should be used in the playbook to execute all of the role
tasks as well as role dependencies.
