.sp
The \fBdebops.debops_legacy\fP Ansible role can be used to clean up legacy files,
directories, APT packages or \fBdpkg\-divert\fP diversions created by
DebOps but no longer used.
.sp
The role is not included in the main DebOps playbook to not cause data
destruction by mistake. You are advised to use it with caution \- it will
destroy data on your DebOps hosts. To check the changes that will be done
before implementing them, you can run the role against DebOps hosts with:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
debops service/debops_legacy \-l <host> \-\-diff \-\-check
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Any changes that the role will create on the hosts can be overridden via the
Ansible inventory if needed.
.SH GETTING STARTED
.SS Example inventory
.sp
The \fBdebops.debops_legacy\fP role doesn\(aqt need to be enabled in Ansible
inventory, since its playbook by default works against the hosts in the
\fB[debops_all_hosts]\fP Ansible inventory group. However the role is not
included in the \fBsite.yml\fP playbook and needs to be executed specifically by
the system administrator to perform work.
.SS Example playbook
.sp
If you are using this role without DebOps, here\(aqs an example Ansible playbook
that uses the \fBdebops.debops_legacy\fP role:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-\-\-

\- name: Clean up legacy configuration
  collections: [ \(aqdebops.debops\(aq, \(aqdebops.roles01\(aq,
                 \(aqdebops.roles02\(aq, \(aqdebops.roles03\(aq ]
  hosts: [ \(aqdebops_all_hosts\(aq ]
  become: True

  environment: \(aq{{ inventory__environment | d({})
                   | combine(inventory__group_environment | d({}))
                   | combine(inventory__host_environment  | d({})) }}\(aq

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Ansible tags
.sp
You can use Ansible \fB\-\-tags\fP or \fB\-\-skip\-tags\fP parameters to limit what
tasks are performed during Ansible run. This can be used after a host was first
configured to speed up playbook execution, when you are sure that most of the
configuration is already in the desired state.
.sp
Available role tags:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBrole::debops_legacy\fP
Main role tag, should be used in the playbook to execute all of the role
tasks as well as role dependencies.
.UNINDENT
.SH DEFAULT VARIABLE DETAILS
.sp
Some of \fBdebops.debops_legacy\fP default variables have more extensive configuration
than simple strings or lists, here you can find documentation and examples for
them.
.SS debops_legacy__remove_diversions
.sp
The \fBdebops_legacy__remove_*_diversions\fP variables define the
\fBdpkg\-divert\fP diversions that will be removed by the role. The
existing files will be deleted and the original files diverted by DebOps will
be moved back into place.
.sp
The variables are list with YAML dictionaries, each dictionary defines one file
with specific parameters:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBname\fP
Required. Absolute path of the file that will be reverted. This parameter is
used as a key for merging different configuration entries together.
.TP
.B \fBdiversion\fP
Optional. Absolute path of the diverted file to revert into its original
place. If not specified, the filename is defined as:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{{ item.name }}.dpkg\-divert
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBstate\fP
Optional. If not specified or \fBpresent\fP, the existing diversion will be
kept in place. If \fBabsent\fP, the diversion will be removed.
.sp
If \fBignore\fP, a given configuration entry will not be evaluated by the role
during execution, allowing conditional activation of the tasks.
.UNINDENT
.SS Examples
.sp
Remove existing diversion of a configuration file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.SS debops_legacy__remove_packages
.sp
The \fBdebops_legacy__remove_*_packages\fP variables define the
APT packages which should be removed by the role. The variables are list of
YAML entries, each entry defines one APT package to remove using specific
parameters:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBname\fP
Required. Name of the APT package to remove.
.TP
.B \fBstate\fP
Optional. If not specified or \fBpresent\fP, the existing APT package will be
kept in place, or installed if it\(aqs not present. If \fBabsent\fP, existing APT
package will be removed.
.sp
If \fBignore\fP, a given configuration entry will not be evaluated by the role
during execution, allowing conditional activation of the task.
.UNINDENT
.SS Examples
.sp
Remove existing package conditionally, else leave the existing state
(installed/uninstalled) as is:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.SS debops_legacy__remove_files
.sp
The \fBdebops_legacy__remove_*_files\fP variables define the files or directories
which should be removed by the role. The variables are list of YAML entries,
each entry defines one file or directory to remove using specific parameters:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBname\fP
Required. Absolute path of the file or directory to remove.
.TP
.B \fBstate\fP
Optional. If not specified or \fBpresent\fP, the existing file will be left in
place. Non\-existent files or directories will result in an error. If
\fBabsent\fP, existing file or directory will be removed.
.sp
If \fBignore\fP, a given configuration entry will not be evaluated by the role
during execution, allowing conditional activation of the task.
