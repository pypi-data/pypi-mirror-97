.sp
\fI\%Elasticsearch\fP <\fBhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch\fP> is a distributed
search engine and storage system, also a part of the Elastic Stack.
The software is developed by \fI\%Elastic\fP <\fBhttps://www.elastic.co/\fP>\&.
.sp
The \fBdebops.elasticsearch\fP Ansible role can be used to deploy and manage
Elasticsearch instances on one or more (3+) hosts. The role can be used as
a dependency by other Ansible roles to allow control over their configuration
options in the Elasticsearch configuration file.
.SH GETTING STARTED
.SS Upstream package is used by default
.sp
The Debian and Ubuntu archives contain the \fBelasticsearch\fP packages, however
they are very old releases (1.x). The \fI\%security support for the package in Debian has been discontinued\fP <\fBhttps://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2015/msg00290.html\fP>
due to issues with upstream security policy (\fI\%Debian Bug #803713\fP <\fBhttps://bugs.debian.org/803713\fP>).
Debian Developers suggest that \fI\%in production environments the upstream version should be used\fP <\fBhttps://bugs.debian.org/829078\fP>
to provide adequate security updates.
.sp
Due to the above reasons, the role is focused on the upstream Elasticsearch
release only (5.x+). The package installation itself is handled by the
\fBdebops.elastic_co\fP Ansible role which also manages upstream APT repository
configuration.
.SS Elasticsearch is insecure by default
.sp
The Elasticsearch service in the default configuration supports only plaintext
connections between the cluster nodes themselves, and between the cluster and
clients. There\(aqs no client authentication or authorization policies as well.
Due to that you should take care to not expose your Elasticsearch cluster to
the outside world without proper encryption and authentication.
.sp
You can install additional plugins that provide encrypted connections,
authentication, authorization and access control:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%X\-Pack\fP <\fBhttps://www.elastic.co/products/x-pack\fP>, an Elastic
commercial plugin with free trial period. Supports encryption,
authentication, access control, integrates with Kibana and Logstash. Since
the plugin is developed by the same team, its releases are in parallel with
Elasticsearch.
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%Search Guard\fP <\fBhttps://search-guard.com/\fP>, an open source third
party plugin with commercial support. Has features comparable with X\-Pack,
with more basic features like HTTP and transport encryption, basic
authentication and access control available free of charge.
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%ReadonlyREST\fP <\fBhttps://readonlyrest.com/\fP>, an open source security plugin
focused on the Elasticsearch HTTP REST interface security.
.UNINDENT
.SS Standalone deployment or cluster
.sp
With the default configuration, the \fBdebops.elasticsearch\fP role will deploy
the Elasticsearch service in a "standalone" mode without exposing the service
to the outside world. This allows easy deployments for development or testing
purposes.
.sp
In production environment, you are strongly advised to deploy Elasticsearch on
at least three (3) nodes to ensure consistency in the cluster. To enable
cluster mode, you will need to configure the firewall for Elasticsearch and use
one or multiple Ansible inventory groups to design your cluster architecture.
.sp
The role currently does not support deployment of multiple Elasticsearch
instances on one host. As an alternative, consider setting up an internal
container environment with each Elasticsearch instance in a separate container
with its own IP address or use \fI\%Elastic Cloud Elasticsearch Service\fP <\fBhttps://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service\fP> which does this for you and more.
.sp
See the elasticsearch__ref_clustering for more details.
.SS Use as a role dependency
.sp
The Elasticsearch main configuration file
\fI\%does not support an include statement or conf.d directory\fP <\fBhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11362\fP>\&.
To mitigate that and allow multiple Elasticsearch configuration sources from
other Ansible roles, the \fBdebops.elasticsearch\fP role supports operation as
a dependent role. This functionality can be used by other Ansible roles to
better manage Elasticsearch plugins or extend the cluster configuration without
the need to implement the entire role again and with preserved idempotency.
.sp
See the elasticsearch__ref_dependency for more details.
.SS Example inventory
.sp
To deploy Elasticsearch in a standalone mode, you can add the host to the
\fB[debops_service_elasticsearch]\fP Ansible inventory group:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[debops_service_elasticsearch]
hostname
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The default playbook supports use of different Ansible inventory groups for
different types of Elasticsearch nodes.
See elasticsearch__ref_clustering for more details.

.SS Ansible tags
.sp
You can use Ansible \fB\-\-tags\fP or \fB\-\-skip\-tags\fP parameters to limit what
tasks are performed during Ansible run. This can be used after a host was first
configured to speed up playbook execution, when you are sure that most of the
configuration is already in the desired state.
.sp
Available role tags:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBrole::elasticsearch\fP
Main role tag, should be used in the playbook to execute all of the role
tasks as well as role dependencies.
.TP
.B \fBrole::elasticsearch:config\fP
Generate the Elasticsearch configuration taking into account different
configuration sources.
.UNINDENT
.SH DEFAULT VARIABLE DETAILS
.sp
Some of \fBdebops.elasticsearch\fP default variables have more extensive
configuration than simple strings or lists, here you can find documentation and
examples for them.
.SS elasticsearch__configuration
.sp
The \fBelasticsearch__*_configuration\fP variables define the Elasticsearch
configuration options that are set in the
\fB/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml\fP configuration file.
.sp
The main Elasticsearch configuration file format is YAML.
The \fI\%reference documentation\fP <\fBhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/settings.html\fP>
defines two YAML formats recognized by Elasticsearch, hierarchical (YAML
dictionary keys are indented), or flat (YAML dictionary keys are separated by
dots). This role focuses only on the latter, flat format since it\(aqs used
everywhere in the Elasticsearch documentation and seems to be the preferred
method for the majority of the configuration options.
.sp
For quick reference, the Elasticsearch configuration file contains options in the
following format:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
cluster.name: example\-cluster
node.name: node\-1
network.host: [ _local_, _site_ ]
bootstrap.memory_lock: true
discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes: 3
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBelasticsearch__*_configuration\fP variables are YAML lists of
dictionaries. Each YAML dictionary defines an option, or redefines a previously
defined option (the variables are flattened and then processed in order).
.sp
The first YAML dictionary key of each option (in above case, \fBcluster\fP,
\fBnode\fP, \fBnetwork\fP, \fBbootstrap\fP, \fBdiscovery\fP is significant, and is used
to separate configuration options into sections defined by the
\fBelasticsearch__configuration_sections\fP variable.
.sp
Configuration options can be defined as YAML dictionaries directly, with the
key being the name of the option, and value being its value:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
elasticsearch__configuration:
  \- \(aqcluster.name\(aq: \(aqexample\-cluster\(aq
  \- \(aqnode.name\(aq: \(aqnode\-1\(aq
  \- \(aqnetwork.host\(aq: [ \(aq_local_\(aq, \(aq_site_\(aq ]
  \- \(aqbootstrap.memory_lock\(aq: True
  \- \(aqdiscovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes\(aq: 3
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The extended YAML dictionary format is detected if a YAML dictionary contains
a \fBname\fP key. The dictionaries support specific parameters:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBname\fP
String. The name of the Elasticsearch option.
.TP
.B \fBvalue\fP
The value of the Elasticsearch option. Can be a string, a number, a boolean
or a YAML list.
.TP
.B \fBcomment\fP
An optional comment added to the option, either as a string or a YAML text
block.
.TP
.B \fBstate\fP
If not specified or \fBpresent\fP, the option will be included in the
configuration. If \fBabsent\fP, the option will not be included. If
\fBcomment\fP, the option will be present but commented out (it\(aqs an internal
feature and may not work reliably for all cases).
.TP
.B \fBoptions\fP
Optional, a YAML dictionary with keys being the "leaf" configuration names of
the primary key, and value being their values. This parameter can be used to
group several similar configuration options together in the generated
configuration file, for readability. When this parameter is used, the "leaf"
part of the main configuration name is discarded, and only used as a marker
for these parameters. An example configuration:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
elasticsearch__configuration:
  \- name: \(aqnode.meta.host_type\(aq
    comment: \(aqNode type\(aq
    options:
      \(aqmaster\(aq: True
      \(aqdata\(aq:   True
      \(aqingest\(aq: True
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The above configuration should result in:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Node type
node.master: true
node.data: true
node.ingest: true
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBraw\fP
Optional, a YAML text block. The name of the configuration option will be
discarded and used only as a marker for these parameters. The contents of the
\fBraw\fP key will be added as\-is to the configuration file. You can use this
to include more extensive configuration defined as a hierarchical YAML
structure. An example configuration which should be equivalent to the
previous example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
elasticsearch__configuration:
  \- name: \(aqnode.meta.host_type\(aq
    raw: |
      # Node type
      node.master: true
      node.data: true
      node.ingest: true
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You should make sure that the indentation of the YAML parameters is consistent
through the configuration file.
.SS elasticsearch__configuration_sections
.sp
The \fB/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml\fP configuration file is
structured in informal \(aqsections", each section contains configuration options
from a specific group (\fBnode\fP, \fBcluster\fP, etc.). The
\fBelasticsearch__configuration_sections\fP contains a YAML list of
sections and option types to associate with them. The order of the entries on
the list determines the order of the sections in the finished configuration
file.
.sp
Each section definition is a YAML dictionary with specific parameters:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBname\fP
Name of the section, stored as a comment.
.TP
.B \fBpart\fP or \fBparts\fP
A string or a YAML list of configuration option prefixes (first YAML
dictionary key of a given configuration option). Only the parts defined for
a given section will be included in that section.
.UNINDENT
.sp
After all of the sections are processed, any left over configuration options
not matched with a particular section will be added at the end of the
configuration file.
.SS elasticsearch__plugins
.sp
The \fBelasticsearch__*_plugins\fP variables are YAML lists that can be used to
install or remove Elasticsearch plugins. Support for plugin management using
these variables is minimalistic; you can install plugins known by the Elastic
\fI\%plugin repository\fP <\fBhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/current/index.html\fP>,
or from an URL. More involved management can be done by creating a separate
role and using \fBdebops.elasticsearch\fP as a role dependency to manage
configuration if necessary. See elasticsearch__ref_dependency for more
details.
.sp
Each element of the list is a YAML dictionary with specific parameters:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBname\fP
Required. Name of the plugin that shows up in the output of the
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C

.sp
command. This parameter will be used to check the state of the plugin.
.TP
.B \fBurl\fP
Optional. If the plugin is distributed via an URL, you can provide it here
for the plugin management script to use instead of the plugin name.
.TP
.B \fBstate\fP
Optional. If not specified or \fBpresent\fP, the plugin and its configuration
will be installed. If \fBabsent\fP the plugin and its configuration will be
removed.
.TP
.B \fBconfiguration\fP or \fBconfig\fP
Optional. Custom configuration for a given plugin, in the format recognized
by the main configuration template.

.SH ELASTICSEARCH CLUSTERING
.sp
The Elasticsearch service can be deployed either on a single host in
a "standalone" mode, or in a cluster of multiple hosts. The cluster mode will be enabled automatically after a few important variables and inventory groups are configured.
.SS Standalone mode vs cluster mode
.sp
In a standalone mode, the Elasticsearch service will not try to talk with any
other Elasticsearch nodes. Service will be usable over \fBlocalhost\fP
connection. This mode is good for prototyping, testing and development
environments, however it\(aqs not very resilient.
.sp
In a cluster mode, multiple Elasticsearch nodes talk to each other in
a configured network subnet, over TCP. Elasticsearch
clients communicate with the cluster over HTTP REST interface, usually via
a dedicated host with Kibana and/or Logstash as an intermediary.
.SS Playbook execution
.sp
When multiple Elasticsearch hosts are managed as a cluster, any changes in the
cluster configuration should be implemented on all hosts in the cluster at the
same time to avoid issues with split\-brain or quorum. The role uses inventory
groups to compute some specific values for all hosts in the cluster, however
using the \fB\-\-limit\fP parameter of the \fBansible\-playbook\fP command will
only configure those values on a subset of hosts. Remember to always keep the
whole cluster configuration synchronized by running the Elasticsearch playbook
on all hosts included in the cluster (without the \fB\-\-limit\fP parameter).
.SS Ansible inventory groups
.sp
The \fBdebops.elasticsearch\fP role uses a set of Ansible inventory groups to
detect the Elasticsearch node type and change the configuration accordingly.
.sp
The main inventory group is \fB[debops_service_elasticsearch]\fP\&. Hosts in this
group are configured to behave in the same way \- all of them are eligible to be
a master host, all of them can hold data, and all of them can use an ingest
pipeline to process the input. This group is useful in small clusters,
typically <10 hosts in total.
.sp
In larger clusters, the system administrator may want to separate the cluster
hosts into separate node types. Each Ansible inventory group enables a separate
feature, and hosts can be in multiple groups at once to mix and match the
desired features:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB[debops_service_elasticsearch_master]\fP
Hosts in this Ansible inventory group are eligible to become masters.
.TP
.B \fB[debops_service_elasticsearch_data]\fP
Hosts in this Ansible inventory group can hold data shards.
.TP
.B \fB[debops_service_elasticsearch_ingest]\fP
Hosts in this Ansible inventory group can process incoming data via an ingest
pipeline.
.TP
.B \fB[debops_service_elasticsearch_lb]\fP
Hosts in this Ansible inventory group do not have any features explicitly
enabled, and act as load balancers and coordinators within the cluster.
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can check the \fI\%Elasticsearch node documentation\fP <\fBhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-node.html\fP>
for more details about node features.
.sp
The inventory groups and their corresponding node functions are defined using
default variables. The role uses Ansible inventory groups to automatically
determine the list of hosts which will be used for discovery, as well as the number
of eligible master hosts, therefore direct changes to the node function
variables should be done with care.
.SS Unicast host discovery, number of master hosts
.sp
The role automatically manages the list of hosts which should be contacted for
initial host discovery and number of master\-eligible nodes based on the Ansible
inventory group membership.
.sp
If the \fB[debops_service_elasticsearch_master]\fP group is not used, all of the
hosts in the \fB[debops_service_elasticsearch]\fP inventory group will be added
to the unicast discovery list, and all of them will be eligible to become
masters.
.sp
When hosts are included in the \fB[debops_service_elasticsearch_master]\fP
inventory group, only hosts in this group will be able to become masters, and
only hosts in this group will be used for initial unicast discovery. Remember
to always include an odd number of master\-eligible hosts to achieve quorum
majority within the cluster.
.SS Firewall configuration
.sp
The role supports a firewall managed by the debops.ferm Ansible role. When the
firewall is enabled, Elasticsearch will be configured to listen to connections
on private IP addresses defined on the host along with the \fBlocalhost\fP; if
the firewall is not detected or disabled, Elasticsearch will listen only on the
\fBlocalhost\fP interface by default.
.sp
To enable cluster mode, you need to define at least one IP address or a CIDR
subnet in the \fBelasticsearch__allow_tcp\fP list. Make sure to only allow
access from trusted hosts!
.sp
There\(aqs also a separate \fBelasticsearch__allow_http\fP variable, but you
don\(aqt need to enable it unless you need a direct access to the Elasticsearch
HTTP REST interface from remote hosts. Kibana and Logstash installed on the
same host as an Elasticsearch service should be able to talk to it over
\fBlocalhost\fP with no issues.
.SH USAGE AS A ROLE DEPENDENCY
.sp
The \fBdebops.elasticsearch\fP role can be used as a dependency by other Ansible
roles to manage Elasticsearch main configuration file idempotently.
Configuration options from multiple roles can be merged together and included
in the configuration file, or removed conditionally.
.SS Dependent role variables
.sp
The role exposes three default variables that can be used by other Ansible
roles as dependent variables:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBelasticsearch__dependent_role\fP
Required. Name of the role that uses the \fBdebops.elasticsearch\fP as
a dependency. This will be used to store the configuration in its own YAML
dictionary. The selected name shouldn\(aqt be changed, otherwise configuration
will be desynchronized.
.TP
.B \fBelasticsearch__dependent_configuration\fP
Required. List of the Elasticsearch configuration options defined in the same
format as the main configuration. See elasticsearch__ref_configuration
for more details.
.TP
.B \fBelasticsearch__dependent_state\fP
Optional. If not specified or \fBpresent\fP, the configuration will be included
in the \fB/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml\fP configuration file and
stored as Ansible local fact. If \fBabsent\fP, the configuration will be
removed from the generated configuration file.
.UNINDENT
.SS Dependent configuration storage and retrieval
.sp
The dependent configuration from other roles is stored in the \fBsecret/\fP
directory on the Ansible Controller (see debops.secret for more details) in
a JSON file, with each role configuration in a separate dictionary. The
\fBdebops.elasticsearch\fP reads this file when Ansible local facts indicate that
the Elasticsearch service is installed, otherwise a new empty file is created.
This ensures that the stale configuration is not present on a new or
re\-installed host.
.sp
The YAML dictionaries from different roles are be merged with the main
configuration in the \fBelasticsearch__combined_configuration\fP variable
that is used to generate the final configuration. The merge order of the
different \fBelasticsearch__*_configuration\fP variables allows to further affect
the dependent configuration through Ansible inventory if necessary, therefore
the Ansible roles that use this method don\(aqt need to provide additional
variables for this purpose themselves.
