.sp
The \fBdebops.netbase\fP Ansible role manages the hostname stored in
\fB/etc/hostname\fP, as well as the local host and network database located
in \fB/etc/hosts\fP and \fB/etc/networks\fP files, respectively.  It can be
used as a substitute for a DNS service for small number of hosts; with bigger
network or larger clusters usage of a real DNS server is preferred.
.SH GETTING STARTED
.SS Example inventory
.sp
The role is included by default in the \fBbootstrap.yml\fP and \fBcommon.yml\fP
playbook, therefore you don\(aqt need to do anything to enable it.
.SS Example playbook
.sp
If you are using this role without DebOps, here\(aqs an example Ansible playbook
that uses the \fBdebops.netbase\fP role:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-\-\-

\- name: Manage local host and network database
  collections: [ \(aqdebops.debops\(aq, \(aqdebops.roles01\(aq,
                 \(aqdebops.roles02\(aq, \(aqdebops.roles03\(aq ]
  hosts: [ \(aqdebops_all_hosts\(aq, \(aqdebops_service_netbase\(aq ]
  become: True

  environment: \(aq{{ inventory__environment | d({})
                   | combine(inventory__group_environment | d({}))
                   | combine(inventory__host_environment  | d({})) }}\(aq

.SS Ansible tags
.sp
You can use Ansible \fB\-\-tags\fP or \fB\-\-skip\-tags\fP parameters to limit what
tasks are performed during Ansible run. This can be used after a host was first
configured to speed up playbook execution, when you are sure that most of the
configuration is already in the desired state.
.sp
Available role tags:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBrole::netbase\fP
Main role tag, should be used in the playbook to execute all of the role
tasks as well as role dependencies.

.SH DEFAULT VARIABLE DETAILS
.sp
Some of \fBdebops.netbase\fP default variables have more extensive configuration
than simple strings or lists, here you can find documentation and examples for
them.
.SS netbase__hosts
.sp
The \fBnetbase__*_hosts\fP variables are used to define the host records in the
\fB/etc/hosts\fP database. Each variable is a list of YAML dictionaries, the
entries with the same \fBname\fP parameter or the dictionary key are combined
together; this allows modification of the earlier entries by the later ones.
See \fI\%hosts(5)\fP <\fBhttps://manpages.debian.org/hosts(5)\fP> for more details.
.SS Examples
.sp
Add a Fully Qualified Domain Name host entry with IPv4 and IPv6 addresses:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

.ft C
netbase__hosts:

  \- \(aq2001:db8::1\(aq: [ \(aqhost.example.org\(aq, \(aqhost\(aq ]

  \- \(aq192.0.2.2\(aq:   \(aqother.example.org\(aq
.ft P

Add a host entry with IP address specified by a variable:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

host_address: \(aq192.0.2.1\(aq
host_fqdn_hostname: [ \(aqhost.example.org\(aq, \(aqhost\(aq ]

Remove a host record from the \fB/etc/hosts\fP database:

.INDENT 3.5
.sp

.SS Syntax
.sp
Each element in the list variables is a YAML dictionary. If the dictionary
contains the \fBname\fP parameter, it will be evaluated as the "expanded" form
with specific parameters:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBname\fP
Required. The IP address of a given host entry. In this form it can be
a variable. The entries with the same \fBname\fP parameter (or the dictionary
key in the simple form) are merged together, this allows to change the
specific entries in the inventory without the need to copy the entire list.
.sp
If the \fBname\fP is empty, the host record will not be added to the database.
.TP
.B \fBvalue\fP
Required. A string or a YAML list with host addresses to define for a given
host record. If the list is used, lists from multiple entries are combined
together. To reset a list, specify an entry with an empty string as the
value.
.sp
If the value is empty, the host record will be removed from the database.
.TP
.B \fBseparator\fP
Optional, boolean. If set and \fBTrue\fP, the generated template will contain an
empty line before a given entry, to allow for better readability. This
parameter is ignored when the \fBlineinfile\fP mode is used to manage the
database.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the YAML dictionary does not contain a \fBname\fP entry, the entire dictionary
is interpreted using the following simplified format: keys are the IP addresses
of the host records, and values are strings or YAML lists with the hostnames or
FQDN domains. It\(aqs best to use only 1 dictionary key for each host record, and
not combine multiple entries together in one list element.
