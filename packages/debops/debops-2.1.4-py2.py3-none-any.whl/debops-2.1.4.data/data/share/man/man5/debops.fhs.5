.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
By default various DebOps application roles install their data in directories
designated by the \fI\%Filesystem Hierarchy Standard\fP <\fBhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard\fP> for locally\-installed
software \- for example \fB/usr/local/bin/\fP for binaries,
\fB/usr/local/src/\fP for source code, and so on. To allow system
administrators to easily change the preferred location of various resources
without the need to modify multiple roles separately, the debops.fhs
role is a central place which defines base directories for other roles to use.
.sp
The base directories are created by the role, and a special
\fB/etc/ansible/facts.d/fhs.fact\fP script is generated on the host. It
serves dual purpose \- the facts are used to ensure that any changes in the
directory paths don\(aqt affect existing installations, and can be used by other
Ansible roles to define various resource paths in their variables.
.SH GETTING STARTED
.SS Ansible local facts
.sp
The debops.fhs role creates a local fact script on the managed hosts
which defines variables under the \fBansible_local.fhs.*\fP hierarchy. Other
Ansible roles can use these variables to reference the base directories managed
by the debops.fhs role. This method provides a central place to control
where various data (shared files, binaries, application directories, etc.) is
stored in the filesystem. Furthermore, the role takes extra care to not modify
existing paths once applied, to ensure that the local facts stay consistent.
.sp
An example usage of the Ansible local facts defined by the role \- define path
to the home directory of an application in the role default variables:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
application__user: \(aqexample\-app\(aq

application__home: \(aq{{ (ansible_local.fhs.home | d("/var/local"))
                       + "/" + application__user }}\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Example inventory
.sp
The debops.fhs role is included in the \fBcommon.yml\fP DebOps playbook as
well as the bootstrap playbooks and you don\(aqt need to do anything to apply it
on the host.
.SS Example playbook
.sp
If you are using this role without DebOps, here\(aqs an example Ansible playbook
that uses the \fBdebops.fhs\fP role:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-\-\-

\- name: Configure base directory hierarchy
  collections: [ \(aqdebops.debops\(aq, \(aqdebops.roles01\(aq,
                 \(aqdebops.roles02\(aq, \(aqdebops.roles03\(aq ]
  hosts: [ \(aqdebops_all_hosts\(aq, \(aqdebops_service_fhs\(aq ]
  become: True

  environment: \(aq{{ inventory__environment | d({})
                   | combine(inventory__group_environment | d({}))
                   | combine(inventory__host_environment  | d({})) }}\(aq

  roles:

    \- role: fhs
      tags: [ \(aqrole::fhs\(aq, \(aqskip::fhs\(aq ]

.ft P

.SS Ansible tags
.sp
You can use Ansible \fB\-\-tags\fP or \fB\-\-skip\-tags\fP parameters to limit what
tasks are performed during Ansible run. This can be used after a host was first
configured to speed up playbook execution, when you are sure that most of the
configuration is already in the desired state.
.sp
Available role tags:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBrole::fhs\fP
Main role tag, should be used in the playbook to execute all of the role
tasks as well as role dependencies.
.UNINDENT
.SH DEFAULT VARIABLE DETAILS
.sp
Some of \fBdebops.fhs\fP default variables have more extensive configuration than
simple strings or lists, here you can find documentation and examples for them.
.SS fhs__directories
.sp
The \fBfhs__*_directories\fP variables define the list of base directories to
create by the role. The directory paths are saved using an Ansible local fact
to ensure that any changes after applying the role don\(aqt affect an existing
installation. To modify existing paths, the
\fB/etc/ansible/facts.d/fhs.fact\fP script should be removed from the host,
this will ensure that the role does not use existing paths from the facts.
.SS Examples
.sp
Modify the application data directory to store them in a separate mount point
instead of the \fB/srv/\fP directory (you can use debops.mount role to
mount a local device under that directory, or debops.nfs to configure
a remote NFS filesystem):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
fhs__directories:

  \- name: \(aqdata\(aq
    path: \(aq/data\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Remember that this change will only take effect on first application of the
role, therefore it should be defined in the Ansible inventory before the host
is provisioned.
.sp
The role will create the \fB/srv/www/\fP directory by default since it\(aqs
a common place for home directories of web applications. To avoid this on
non\-www related hosts, you can put the configuration below in the inventory:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
fhs__directories:

  \- name: \(aqwww\(aq
    state: \(aqabsent\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Syntax
.sp
Each base directory is defined as a YAML dictionary with specific parameters:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBname\fP
Required. The short name of the directory, used as a reference in the Ansible
local facts. The configuration entries with the same \fBname\fP parameter are
merged together, this can be used to modify the paths defined by the role via
Ansible inventory.
.TP
.B \fBpath\fP
Required. An absolute path of the base directory to create. The path needs to
start with the \fB/\fP character, otherwise it will not be created by the role.
.TP
.B \fBmode\fP
Optional. Specify the permissions of the base directory. If not specified,
\fB0755\fP will be used by default.
.TP
.B \fBstate\fP
Optional. If not specified or \fBpresent\fP, the path will be created by the
role. If \fBabsent\fP, the role will not create this path (existing paths are
not removed).
