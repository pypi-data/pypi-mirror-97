.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fB/etc/resolv.conf\fP configuration file defines the system\-wide DNS
resolver configuration. It is a central location to configure the DNS
nameservers, search domains and other options. In modern Linux systems, many
services might want to change that configuration file to enable their
functionality \- \fI\%NetworkManager\fP <\fBhttps://wiki.debian.org/NetworkManager\fP>, \fBifupdown\fP, \fI\%dnsmasq\fP <\fBhttps://wiki.debian.org/HowTo/dnsmasq\fP>, \fBunbound\fP
being several examples of that.
.sp
To avoid clashes between various software packages modifying the
\fB/etc/resolv.conf\fP file, the \fBresolvconf\fP package provides a stable API
to the \fB/etc/resolv.conf\fP that combines information from other services
and creates a consistent resolver configuration.
.sp
The \fBdebops.resolvconf\fP Ansible role further updates the \fBresolvconf\fP
configuration to fix issues with outdated defaults on modern Debian/Ubuntu
hosts. By default the role will update the interface order list to include the
\fI\%Predictable Network Interface Names\fP <\fBhttps://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/\fP> as well as clarify the order of the
NetworkManager interfaces. The role will also automatically rearrange the
configuration of VPN tunnels if a local DNS resolver is detected.
.sp
Contrary to its name, the \fBdebops.resolvconf\fP role does not configure the
\fB/etc/resolv.conf\fP file directly. You should consult the documentation of
various DNS\-related services to see how you can modify the contents of this
file through them.
.SH GETTING STARTED
.SS Support for static configuration
.sp
In addition to handling DNS configuration from multiple sources, the role
supports "static" DNS configuration created via a script. To use it, set the
\fBresolvconf__static_enabled\fP variable to \fBTrue\fP, and specify the
\fI\%resolv.conf(5)\fP <\fBhttps://manpages.debian.org/resolv.conf(5)\fP> configuration as a string or YAML text block:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
resolvconf__static_content: |
  nameserver 192.0.2.1
  search example.org example.net
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The script will create a file in the \fBresolvconf\fP runtime directory,
by default named \fBlo.static\fP, which will merge the specified
configuration with other DNS sources. The role will also configure
\fBsystemd\fP to apply the static configuration on system boot.
.SS Example inventory
.sp
The \fBdebops.resolvconf\fP role is included by default in the \fBcommon.yml\fP
DebOps playbook; you don\(aqt need to add hosts to any Ansible groups to enable
it.
.SS Example playbook
.sp
If you are using this role without DebOps, here\(aqs an example Ansible playbook
that uses the \fBdebops.resolvconf\fP role:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.ft C

.SS Ansible tags
.sp
You can use Ansible \fB\-\-tags\fP or \fB\-\-skip\-tags\fP parameters to limit what
tasks are performed during Ansible run. This can be used after a host was first
configured to speed up playbook execution, when you are sure that most of the
configuration is already in the desired state.
.sp
Available role tags:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBrole::resolvconf\fP
Main role tag, should be used in the playbook to execute all of the role
tasks as well as role dependencies.

.SH DEFAULT VARIABLE DETAILS
.sp
Some of \fBdebops.resolvconf\fP default variables have more extensive
configuration than simple strings or lists, here you can find documentation and
examples for them.
.SS resolvconf__interface_order
.sp
The \fBresolvconf__*_interface_order\fP variables define the contents of the
\fB/etc/resolvconf/interface\-order\fP configuration file \- see the
\fI\%interface\-order(5)\fP <\fBhttps://manpages.debian.org/interface-order(5)\fP> manual page for details about this file.
.SS Examples
.sp
See the \fBresolvconf__original_interface_order\fP default variable to see
the original contents of the configuration file represented in the role. The
\fBresolvconf__default_interface_order\fP variable contains the
modifications to the original configuration file defined in the role by default
and enabled conditionally.
.SS Syntax
.sp
The contents of the \fBresolvconf__*_interface_order\fP variables are a list of
YAML dictionaries, each dictionary defines a section of the configuration file
using specific parameters:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBname\fP
Required. A name of a given section, used only as a handle for a given
configuration entry. Multiple entries with the same \fBname\fP parameter are
merged together and can affect a given entry in order of appearance.
.TP
.B \fBvalue\fP
Required. A string or a YAML text block which will be inserted in the
generated configuration file. See the \fI\%interface\-order(5)\fP <\fBhttps://manpages.debian.org/interface-order(5)\fP> for details
about what can be defined here.
.TP
.B \fBcomment\fP
Optional. A string or YAML text block with additional comments about a given
configuration entry.
.TP
.B \fBstate\fP
Optional. If not specified or \fBpresent\fP, a given configuration section will
be included in the generated configuration file. If \fBabsent\fP,
a configuration section will be removed from the generated configuration
file. If \fBignore\fP, a given configuration entry will not be evaluated by the
role during its execution.
.TP
.B \fBcopy_id_from\fP
Optional. Name of a configuration entry (its \fBname\fP parameter) from which
a given entry should copy its internal "id" value. This can be used to rougly
place a given configuration entry near the specified configuration section
without the need to modify the order of all of the other entries.
.TP
.B \fBweight\fP
Optional. A positive or negative number which defines an additional "weight"
of a given entry relative to other configuration entries. This parameter can
be used to fine\-tune the order of the configuration sections in the generated
configuration file.
