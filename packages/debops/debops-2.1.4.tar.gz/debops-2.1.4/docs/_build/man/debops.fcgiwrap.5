.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBdebops service/fcgiwrap\fP [\fB\-\-limit\fP \fIgroup,host,\fP\&...] [\fB\-\-diff\fP] [\fB\-\-check\fP] [\fB\-\-tags\fP \fItag1,tag2,\fP\&...] [\fB\-\-skip\-tags\fP \fItag1,tag2,\fP\&...] [<\fBansible\-playbook\fP options>] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fI\%fcgiwrap\fP <\fBhttps://github.com/gnosek/fcgiwrap\fP> is a lightweight FastCGI server which can be set up behind
\fBnginx\fP server to run CGI applications. This role allows you to setup
separate instances of \fBfcgiwrap\fP on different user accounts, each one
accessible through its own UNIX socket.
.SH GETTING STARTED
.SS Initial configuration
.sp
\fBdebops.fcgiwrap\fP role will by default disable the system\-wide \fBfcgiwrap\fP
instance. In its place you will be able to create per\-user \fBfcgiwrap\fP
instances, each with their own socket, running as an unprivileged user.
.sp
Each instance will make sure that specified user account and group exists, you
can specify additional configuration to create accounts with a specific shell or
home directory. By default system accounts (UID/GID < 1000) are used.
.sp
This role requires \fBdebops.core\fP role to configure local fact which provides
the name of the init system used by the host (it does not need to be included
in the role dependencies, it\(aqs enough that it is run once at the beginning of
the playbook).
.SS Example inventory
.sp
To enable \fBfcgiwrap\fP on a host by hand, you need to add that host to
\fB[debops_service_fcgiwrap]\fP host group in Ansible inventory. You will also
need to specify an instance to create. Example inventory:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# inventory/hosts
[debops_service_fcgiwrap]
hostname

# inventory/host_vars/hostname/fcgiwrap.yml
fcgiwrap__instances:
  \- name: \(aqwebapp\(aq
    user: \(aqwebapp\(aq
    group: \(aqwebapp\(aq
    home: \(aq/srv/www/webapp\(aq
    shell: \(aq/bin/false\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This configuration will ensure that specified user account exists and will
start \fBfcgiwrap\fP on that account using system service script. The socket used
by this instance will be created as \fB/run/fcgiwrap\-webapp.socket\fP\&.
.SS Example playbook
.sp
\fBdebops.fcgiwrap\fP is designed to be used from a playbook or a role as role
dependency. Here\(aqs an example configuration:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-\-\-
\- name: Set up web application
  hosts: [ \(aqdebops_service_fcgiwrap\(aq ]
  become: True

  roles:

    \- role: debops.fcgiwrap
      tags: [ \(aqrole::fcgiwrap\(aq ]
      fcgiwrap__instances:
        \- name: \(aqwebapp\(aq
          user: \(aqwebapp\(aq
          group: \(aqwebapp\(aq
.ft P

.SH DEFAULT VARIABLES: CONFIGURATION
.sp
some of \fBdebops.fcgiwrap\fP default variables have more extensive configuration
than simple strings or lists, here you can find documentation and examples for
them.
.SS fcgiwrap__instances
.sp
List of \fBfcgiwrap\fP user instances, each one defined by a YAML dictionary.
These instances will configure system services (init scripts on \fBsysvinit\fP
and units on \fBsystemd\fP) which will start \fBfcgiwrap\fP unprivileged on
specified user account.
.sp
