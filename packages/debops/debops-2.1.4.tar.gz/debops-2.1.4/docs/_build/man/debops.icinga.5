.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fI\%Icinga\fP <\fBhttps://www.icinga.com/\fP> project is a monitoring solution which can be used to monitor
infrastructure hosts and services. Icinga can use variety of remote agents as
well as SNMP to monitor remote hosts.
.sp
DebOps provides support for Icinga 2, split into several roles:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
the debops.icinga role is the Icinga 2 Agent role, usually installed
on all hosts in the cluster that should be monitored. Different instances can
function as masters, satellites or clients depending on the configuration.
.IP \(bu 2
the debops.icinga_db role can be used to configure the database
support for Icinga 2, used by the web interface. Both PostgreSQL and MariaDB
databases are supported.
.IP \(bu 2
the debops.icinga_web role manages the Icinga 2 Web interface,
including installation of external modules like Icinga 2 Director.
.UNINDENT
.SH GETTING STARTED
.SS Example inventory
.sp
The \fBdebops.icinga\fP role is not included in the \fBcommon.yml\fP playbook and
needs to be activated by adding a host to a specific Ansible inventory group.
The role is designed to be used on all hosts in the cluster, therefore the
easiest way to do this is to include the main DebOps group in the Icinga
inventory group.

.SS Ansible tags
.sp
You can use Ansible \fB\-\-tags\fP or \fB\-\-skip\-tags\fP parameters to limit what
tasks are performed during Ansible run. This can be used after a host was first
configured to speed up playbook execution, when you are sure that most of the
configuration is already in the desired state.
.sp
Available role tags:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBrole::icinga\fP
Main role tag, should be used in the playbook to execute all of the role
tasks as well as role dependencies.
.TP
.B \fBrole::icinga:register\fP
This tag can be used to register an Icinga 2 instance in the Icinga Director
via the REST API. Already registered nodes are not registered again.
.UNINDENT
.SH DEPLOYMENT GUIDE
.SS Deployment design
.sp
The Icinga 2 support in DebOps is designed around installation of Icinga Agents
on all hosts and presence of 1 master/director node. The Icinga 2 Director is
not mandatory, without it the \fBdebops.icinga\fP role can be used to configure
Icinga 2 nodes manually, either through Ansible inventory or via role dependent
variables. However, with Icinga Director, the role can register new Icinga
nodes automatically as long as the specified host templates are prepared
beforehand.
.sp
It\(aqs advisable to test the deployment in a development environment before
applying it in production. This should let you find out possible issues with
DNS and PKI configuration you might encounter.
.SS Icinga 2 inter\-node communication and PKI
.sp
You might need to allow connections to the Icinga API interface, by default on
port 5665, through the firewall. You can do this by setting the
\fBicinga__allow\fP or its group or host equivalent in the inventory.
Usually only the master host needs the access opened, unless you plan to
initiate connections from the master to the clients.
.sp
Icinga 2 uses X.509 certificates for internal communication between the nodes,
therefore the correct DNS records for the hosts are required. When DNS is not
configured properly beforehand, communication between the cluster nodes can be
disrupted.
.sp
At the moment, the debops.icinga role uses the PKI infrastructure
maintained by the debops.pki role to provide X.509 certificates for
Icinga 2 agents. Due to that, automatic registration of the Icinga 2 agents
external to the cluster in the Icinga 2 CA is not possible at this time. It can
be implemented later if there\(aqs demand for it.
.SS DNS SRV records
.sp
The \fBdebops.icinga\fP role uses DNS SRV records to find the addresses of the
master Icinga 2 nodes, as well as the Icinga 2 Director API. The nodes check
the DNS records to determine if they should be configured as the "master"
hosts, or client hosts that register themselves.
.sp
The DNS SRV record service names are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB_icinga\-master._tcp\fP (the master node)
.IP \(bu 2
\fB_icinga\-director._tcp\fP (the director node)
.UNINDENT
.sp
There can be multiple master and director DNS SRV records. The role will
configure multiple master nodes in the \fBzones.conf\fP configuration file,
however only one director node will be used.
.sp
You should create the DNS SRV records for the master and Director hosts,
otherwise all of the Icinga 2 nodes will see themselves as "master" nodes and
won\(aqt try to connect to each other. To do that in \fBdnsmasq\fP, you can
add the configuration options:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
srv\-host = _icinga\-master._tcp.example.org,icinga\-master.example.org,5665
srv\-host = _icinga\-director._tcp.example.org,icinga.example.org,443
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Similar records in the ISC BIND zone file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
_icinga\-master._tcp.example.org.   86400 IN SRV 0 5 5665 icinga\-master.example.org.
_icinga\-director._tcp.example.org. 86400 IN SRV 0 5 443  icinga.example.org.
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The above configuration sets the \fBicinga\-master.example.org\fP host as the
"master" host. The Director API is available on a separate FQDN,
\fBicinga.example.org\fP\&.
.sp
You can also define the master and director nodes explicitly in the inventory
variables, using the Ansible \fBdig\fP lookup syntax. To set the above
configuration, define in the inventory:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
icinga__master_nodes:
  \- target: \(aqicinga\-master.example.org\(aq
    port: \(aq5665\(aq

icinga__director_nodes:
  \- target: \(aqicinga.example.org\(aq
    port: \(aq443\(aq

.SS Initial deployment
.sp
This is an example Ansible inventory for deployment of the full Icinga "stack"
in DebOps environment. The debops.icinga role is applied on all hosts in
the environment, however the debops.icinga_db and
debops.icinga_web are applied only on the master host.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
By default the web interface is configured on the \fBicinga.\fP subdomain, you
can change this by setting the \fBicinga_web__fqdn\fP variable.
.sp
It\(aqs best to start the deployment on the Icinga master node, by setting up the
local Icinga 2 Agent, and the web interface with the Icinga Director. You can
login to the web interface using the \fBroot\fP username and the password stored
in the
\fBsecret/icinga_web/auth/<inventory_hostname>/credentials/root/password\fP
file (see debops.secret for more details).
.sp
After logging in, you should create a new basic host template. By default, the
role will try and register the nodes using the \fBgeneric\-host\fP template. To
create it, go to the "Icinga Director" \-> "Hosts" \-> "Host Templates" section
and click on "Add". Enter "generic\-host" as the "Hostname", set the "Check
command" option as "hostalive". You should also set a reasonable "Check
interval", "Retry interval\(aq and "Max check attempts" fields, for example with
5 minutes, 30 seconds and 5 tries.
.sp
It might be best to add a separate host template for hosts with Icinga 2 Agent
installed, in case that you want to include other hosts as well. For this,
create a new template with a chosen name, and in the "Icinga Agent and zone
settings" section set the "Icinga 2 Agent", "Estabilish connection" and
"Accepts config" options to "Yes". You can define the list of templates
automatically applied during registration using the
\fBicinga__director_register_*_templates\fP default variables.
.sp
After this you can apply the debops.icinga role to other hosts. If
everything was configured correctly, the role should automatically register
a new host in Icinga via the Director REST API. Subsequent execution of the
role will not change the status of the host in Icinga, but if you remove the
host from the web interface and re\-run the debops.icinga role, the host
will be registered again.
.SH USAGE AS A ROLE DEPENDENCY
.sp
The \fBdebops.icinga\fP role can be used as a dependency by other Ansible roles
to manage contents of the \fB/etc/icinga2/\fP directory idempotently.
Configuration options from multiple roles can be merged together and included
in the Icinga 2 configuration, or removed conditionally.
.SS Dependent role variable
.sp
The role exposes the \fBicinga__dependent_configuration\fP variable which
can be used to define Icinga configuration files by other Ansible roles through
the role dependent variables.
.sp
The variable is an YAML list with YAML dictionaries as entries. A short
format of the configuration uses the dictionary key as a name of the dependent
role and dictionary value as that role\(aqs configuration, in the format defined
by icinga__ref_configuration variable, respectively (see playbook
excerpt below):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
roles:

  \- role: icinga
    icinga__dependent_configuration:
      \- role_name: \(aq{{ role_name__icinga__dependent_configuration }}\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The extended version of the configuration uses YAML dictionaries with specific
parameters:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBrole\fP
Required. Name of the role, used to save its configuration in a YAML
dictionary on the Ansible Controller. Shouldn\(aqt be changed once selected,
otherwise the configuration will be desynchronized.
.TP
.B \fBconfig\fP
Required. YAML list with definition of the Icinga configuration files in the
same format defined by icinga__ref_configuration variables.
.TP
.B \fBstate\fP
Optional. If not specified or \fBpresent\fP, the configuration will be included
in the generated configuration files. If \fBabsent\fP, the configuration will
be removed from the configuration files. If \fBignore\fP, a given configuration
entries will be skipped during data evaluation and won\(aqt affect any existing
entries.
.UNINDENT
.sp
An example extended configuration (playbook excerpt):

roles:

  \- role: icinga
    icinga__dependent_configuration:

        config: \(aq{{ role_name__icinga__dependent_configuration }}\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The above configuration layout allows for use of the multiple role dependencies
in one playbook by providing configuration of each role in a separate
configuration entry.
.SS Dependent configuration storage and retrieval
.sp
The dependent configuration from other roles is stored in the \fBsecret/\fP
directory on the Ansible Controller (see debops.secret for more details)
in a JSON file (one for each variable), with each role configuration in
a separate dictionary. The \fBdebops.icinga\fP role reads these files when
Ansible local facts indicate that the Icinga support is installed, otherwise
empty files are created. This ensures that the stale configuration is not
present on a new or re\-installed host.
.sp
The YAML dictionaries from different roles are merged with the main
configuration in the \fBicinga__combined_configuration\fP variable that are
used to generate the final configuration. The merge order of the different
\fBicinga__*_configuration\fP variables allows to further affect the dependent
configuration through Ansible inventory if necessary, therefore the Ansible
roles that use this method don\(aqt need to provide additional variables for this
purpose themselves.
.SH DEFAULT VARIABLE DETAILS
.sp
Some of \fBdebops.icinga\fP default variables have more extensive configuration
than simple strings or lists, here you can find documentation and examples for
them.
.SS icinga__configuration
.sp
The \fBicinga__*_configuration\fP variables specify the contents of the Icinga
2 configuration located in the \fB/etc/icinga2/\fP directory. The variables
are combined together using the \fBicinga__combined_configuration\fP
variable, which means that users don\(aqt need to copy entire values to the
inventory to change it.
.sp
Because Icinga 2 configuration language is extensive, the role is focused only
on conditional activation of the specific files and sections inside. You will
want to read the \fI\%upstream documentation\fP <\fBhttps://www.icinga.com/docs/icinga2/latest/doc/04-configuring-icinga-2/\fP> to learn how to configure Icinga
2 using its DSL.
.sp
The vriables contain lists of YAML dictionaries, each dictionary can be defined
using specific parameters:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBname\fP
Required. The name of the file located in the \fB/etc/icinga2/\fP
directory, for example \fBicinga2.conf\fP\&. This can also include
subdirectories, for example \fBconf.d/templates.conf\fP\&. Missing subdirectories
will be automatically created by the role.
.sp
This parameter is used as a handle for merging multiple configuration entries
together.
.TP
.B \fBfilename\fP
Optional. Alternative filename with optional subdirectories. Can be used to
override the filename specified in the \fBname\fP parameter. Usually not used.
.TP
.B \fBdivert\fP
Optional, boolean. When defined and \fBTrue\fP, this parameter marks the file
as belonging to a \fB\&.deb\fP package. The original file will be diverted or
reverted depending on the \fBstate\fP parameter to allow for unobtrusive
package upgrades. Diverted files have \fB\&.dpkg\-divert\fP suffix and are ignored
by Icinga 2.
.TP
.B \fBstate\fP
Optional. Specify the desired state of a given configuration file. Possible
states:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpresent\fP: default if not defined. The configuration file will be
generated, any original files will be diverted to preserve them.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBabsent\fP: the file will be removed. Any diverted files will be returned
to their original state.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBinit\fP: the configuration of a given file will be primed, but will not be
actually implemented by the role. This can be used to prepare configuration
files to be activated conditionally.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBignore\fP: a given configuration entry will be ignored during template
generation. This can be used to disable specific configuration entries
conditionally.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBdivert\fP: only divert a given configuration file without generating
a custom one. The files will be reverted back when the state is set to
\fBabsent\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfeature\fP: only enable/disable the feature state in the
\fB/etc/icinga2/features\-enabled/\fP directory.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBfeature_name\fP
Optional. Specify name of the symlink managed in the
\fB/etc/icinga2/features\-enabled/\fP directory, without the \fB\&.conf\fP
suffix. This should be only used with configuration files located in the
\fBfeatures\-available/\fP subdirectory, otherwise the generated symlinks
will be broken.
.sp
The \fBname\fP parameter is not correlated with the \fBfeature_name\fP, and is
used only for configuration merging.
.TP
.B \fBfeature_state\fP
Optional. If set and \fBpresent\fP, the symlink to a particular feature file
will be created. If \fBabsent\fP, the symlink to a particular feature will be
removed, thus disabling it.
.TP
.B \fBowner\fP
Optional. Specify the UNIX account owner of the configuration file. If not
specified, \fBroot\fP will be the owner.
.TP
.B \fBgroup\fP
Optional. Specify the UNIX group of the configuration file. If not specified,
\fBroot\fP will be the group.
.TP
.B \fBmode\fP
Optional. Specify the file attributes. If not specified, \fB0644\fP will be
used by default.
.TP
.B \fBno_log\fP
Optional, boolean. If set and \fBTrue\fP, Ansible will not log the generation
of a given configuration file. This might be useful for files with sensitive
data like passwords.
.TP
.B \fBcomment\fP
Optional. String or YAML text block with a comment, included in the beginning
of the configuration file.
.TP
.B \fBvalue\fP
Optional. String or YAML text block that contains the Icinga 2 configuration,
specified using \fI\%Icinga 2 DSL\fP <\fBhttps://www.icinga.com/docs/icinga2/latest/doc/17-language-reference/\fP>\&. It will be included in the configuration
file as\-is.
.TP
.B \fBoptions\fP
Optional. List of configuration snippets that will be included in the file.
It\(aqs an alternative to a single \fBvalue\fP entry which can be used to
conditionally enable or disable parts of the configuration file. Options
lists from different configuration entries are merged together and can affect
each other.
.sp
Each list element is a YAML dictionary with specific parameters:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBname\fP
An element identifier, it is used for merging \fBoptions\fP lists from
different configuration entries and is ignored otherwise. It should be an
unique string.
.TP
.B \fBvalue\fP
Required. String or YAML text block with Icinga 2 configuration written in
is DSL. Will be included as\-is in the configuration file.
.TP
.B \fBcomment\fP
Optional. String or YAML text block with a comment which will be added
before a given element.
.TP
.B \fBstate\fP
Optional. If not set or \fBpresent\fP, the configuration option will be
included in the generated file. If \fBabsent\fP, the configuration option
will not be included in the generated file. If \fBignore\fP, a given list
element is not evaluated by Ansible and will be ignored. If \fBcomment\fP,
the configuration option will be included in the configuration file, but
commented out.
.TP
.B \fBweight\fP
Optional. A positive or negative number that affects the order of the
elements in the options list. It can be used to move configuration lower or
higher in the configuration file.
