.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBdebops service/mount\fP [\fB\-\-limit\fP \fIgroup,host,\fP\&...] [\fB\-\-diff\fP] [\fB\-\-check\fP] [\fB\-\-tags\fP \fItag1,tag2,\fP\&...] [\fB\-\-skip\-tags\fP \fItag1,tag2,\fP\&...] [<\fBansible\-playbook\fP options>] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBdebops.mount\fP Ansible role can be used to manage local filesystem mounts
as well as bind mounts in the \fB/etc/fstab\fP database. Custom directories
can also be created by this role, with support for normal as well as ACL
attributes.
.sp
This role is meant to be used to configure local filesystems, for remote
filesystems, you can use the debops.nfs role instead, which will
configure the NFS client service.
.SH GETTING STARTED
.SS Example inventory
.sp
The \fBdebops.mount\fP role is included by default in the DebOps \fBcommon.yml\fP
playbook and does not need to be explicitly enabled. It can be disabled if
needed, by setting the \fBmount__enabled\fP boolean variable to \fBFalse\fP
in the Ansible inventory.
.SS Example playbook
.sp
If you are using this role without DebOps, here\(aqs an example Ansible playbook
that uses the \fBdebops.mount\fP role:

.SS Ansible tags
.sp
You can use Ansible \fB\-\-tags\fP or \fB\-\-skip\-tags\fP parameters to limit what
tasks are performed during Ansible run. This can be used after a host was first
configured to speed up playbook execution, when you are sure that most of the
configuration is already in the desired state.
.sp
Available role tags:
.INDENT 0.0

.B \fBrole::mount\fP
Main role tag, should be used in the playbook to execute all of the role
tasks as well as role dependencies.

.SH DEFAULT VARIABLE DETAILS
.sp
Some of \fBdebops.mount\fP default variables have more extensive configuration
than simple strings or lists, here you can find documentation and examples for
them.
.SS mount__devices
.sp
The \fBmount__*_devices\fP variables define a list of YAML dictionaries that
configure local device mounts. They can be used to configure any mount type,
however remote devices should be avoided (the role is executed early in the
DebOps \fBcommon.yml\fP playbook, when network configuration might not be
finished), and bind mounts have their own set of variables and a separate task
to allow creation of source directories.
.sp
The role does not create new filesystems, the devices configured by it should
have their own filesystems configured and formatted beforehand.
.SS Examples
.sp
Create an \fB/etc/fstab\fP entry for a disk drive that\(aqs not mounted on boot,
with specific filesystem type:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.UNINDENT
.SS Syntax
.sp
Each \fBmount__*_devices\fP list entry is a YAML dictionary with specific
parameters. Most of the parameters are the same as the Ansible \fBmount\fP
module:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBsrc\fP
Required. A device name which will be mounted at a given path. It can be
a block device file in \fB/dev\fP directory, or a label, or device UUID.
See \fI\%fstab(5)\fP <\fBhttps://manpages.debian.org/fstab(5)\fP> manual page, first field description for more details.
.TP
.B \fBpath\fP / \fBdest\fP / \fBname\fP
Required. Absolute path in the filesystem where a given device will be
mounted.
.TP
.B \fBfstype\fP
Optional. Specify the filesystem type to use with a given device. If not
specified, \fBauto\fP will be used to perform autodetection.
.TP
.B \fBopts\fP
Optional. String (comma\-delimited) or YAML list of options for a given mount
point. If not specified, \fBdefaults\fP will be used instead.
.TP
.B \fBdump\fP
Optional. This field determines which filesystems should be backed up by the
\fI\%dump(8)\fP <\fBhttps://manpages.debian.org/dump(8)\fP> command. If not specified, \fB0\fP is set by default.
.TP
.B \fBpassno\fP
Optional. This field determines the order of the filesystem checks on boot
done by the \fI\%fsck(8)\fP <\fBhttps://manpages.debian.org/fsck(8)\fP> command. The root filesystem should be it set to
\fB1\fP, other filesystems should be set to \fB2\fP\&. If not specified, it
defaults to \fB0\fP, which disables filesystem checks on boot.
.TP
.B \fBstate\fP
Optional. If not specified or \fBmounted\fP, the device entry will be added to
the \fB/etc/fstab\fP database and it will be automatically mounted.
Unmounted devices will be mounted again. If the mount point directory is not
present, it will be automatically created.
.sp
If \fBpresent\fP, the device entry will be added to \fB/etc/fstab\fP, but
Ansible will not try to mount it right away (preferable for automounted
devices). Already mounted devices will not be changed.
.sp
If \fBunmounted\fP, Ansible will try and unmount the already mounted device.
The \fB/etc/fstab\fP database will not be changed, however missing entries
will be added.
.sp
If \fBabsent\fP, the mounted device will be unmounted, and the
\fB/etc/fstab\fP database entry, along with the mount point directory, will
be removed.
.TP
.B \fBfstab\fP
Optional. Absolute path of the alternative \fI\%fstab(5)\fP <\fBhttps://manpages.debian.org/fstab(5)\fP> database to use
instead of the default \fB/etc/fstab\fP database.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Additional parameters control functions outside of the Ansible \fBmount\fP
module:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBdevice\fP
Optional. The role creates the required mount points by itself instead of
letting the Ansible \fBmount\fP module do it; this allows for fine\-grained
control over initial mount point attributes. The task that creates the mount
points is not executed when they are actually mounted \- the role checks if
the \fBsrc\fP parameter is present in the \fBansible_mounts\fP fact entries as
the \fBdevice\fP dictionary key.
.sp
In case that the \fBsrc\fP parameter and the expected \fBdevice\fP dictionary key
are different, you can set the \fBdevice\fP parameter to override the check.
.TP
.B \fBowner\fP
Optional. Specify the UNIX account that will be the owner of the initial
mount point, before the device is mounted. If not specified, \fBroot\fP will be
the owner.
.TP
.B \fBgroup\fP
Optional. Specify the UNIX group that will be the group of the initial mount
point, before the device is mounted. If not specified, the value of \fBowner\fP
is used, otherwise \fBroot\fP will be the group.
.TP
.B \fBmode\fP
Optional. Specify the UNIX permissions that will be applied to the initial
mount point, before the device is mounted. If not specified, \fB0755\fP will be
set by default.
.UNINDENT
.SS mount__directories
.sp
The \fBmount__*_directories\fP variables are list of YAML dictionaries, each
entry defining a directory in the filesystem, with optional attributes.  These
variables can be used to create, modify or remove directories in the
filesystems after they are mounted.
.SS Examples
.sp
Create a directory owned by root on the mounted filesystem:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
mount__directories:

  \- path: \(aq/media/USB_Stick/Private\(aq

.sp
Create directory for data sharing between unprivileged LXC containers. This
assumes that the unprivileged LXC containers are started by \fBroot\fP and use
subUID/subGID range defined by the debops.root_account Ansible role:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

.SS Syntax
.sp
The \fBmount__*_directories\fP lists contain YAML dictionaries, each dictionary
can have specific parameters, that reflect the Ansible \fBfile\fP module
parameters:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBpath\fP / \fBdest\fP / \fBname\fP
Required. Absolute path of the directory that is managed by the role.
.TP
.B \fBowner\fP
Optional. Specify the UNIX account that should be the owner of the directory.
If not specified, \fBroot\fP is used by default.
.TP
.B \fBgroup\fP
Optional. Specify the UNIX group that should be the main group of the given
directory. If not specified, the value of \fBowner\fP is used by default,
otherwise \fBroot\fP is set.
.TP
.B \fBmode\fP
Optional. Set the permissions of the managed directory. If not specified,
\fB0755\fP will be used by default.
.TP
.B \fBrecurse\fP
Optional, boolean. If defined and \fBTrue\fP, the role will set the specified
permissions and ownership recursively to all subdirectories of the given
directory as well as to the directory itself.
.TP
.B \fBstate\fP
Optional. If not specified or \fBdirectory\fP, the given directory will be
created or updated with the specified permissions and ownership. If
\fBabsent\fP, the given directory will be removed. Other values of the
\fBstate\fP parameter are ignored in this role.
.TP
.B \fBacl\fP
Optional. This parameter defines Access Control List entries for a given
directory, each entry is a YAML dictionary with specific parameters:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBentity\fP
Name of the ACL entity to manage, either UNIX account or UNIX group.
.TP
.B \fBetype\fP
The entity type of a given ACL, check the \fI\%setfacl(1)\fP <\fBhttps://manpages.debian.org/setfacl(1)\fP> manual page for
more details. Choices: \fBuser\fP, \fBgroup\fP, \fBother\fP, \fBmask\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBpermissions\fP
Specify the permissions to set for a given ACL entry, they can be
a combination of \fBr\fP (read), \fBw\fP (write) and \fBx\fP (execute).
.TP
.B \fBdefault\fP
Optional, boolean. If defined and \fBTrue\fP, a given ACL entry will be the
default for all entities created inside of a given directory.
.TP
.B \fBfollow\fP
Optional, boolean. If set and \fBTrue\fP, the Ansible module will follow the
symlinked directory to the symlink target and change its attributes instead
of the symlink attributes.
.TP
.B \fBrecursive\fP
Optional, boolean. If set and \fBTrue\fP, the Ansible module will apply the
specified ACL to all objects in a given path.
.TP
.B \fBstate\fP
Optional. If not set or \fBpresent\fP, the ACL entry will be added to the
current object. If \fBabsent\fP, the ACL entry will be removed from the
current path.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS mount__binds
.sp
The \fBmount__*_binds\fP variables can be used to create bind mounted directories
in the filesystem. Bind mounts are similar to symlinks, where a given directory
is mounted at a different place in the filesystem. This can be used to give
access to parts of the filesystem in a different namespace, for example in
a LXC container.
.sp
The task that manages the bind mounts are separate from the "normal" mounts to
allow the system to mount devices that could have parts of their filesystem
bind\-mounted later on.
.SS Examples
.sp
Bind mount the USB drive at a different point in the filesystem:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

Each \fBmount__*_binds\fP list entry is a YAML dictionary with specific
parameters. The parameters are the same as the Ansible \fBmount\fP module:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBsrc\fP
Required. A directory name which will be bind mounted at a given path. The
directory should already exist. You can use the \fI\%mount__directories\fP
variables to create the directories beforehand.
.TP
.B \fBpath\fP / \fBdest\fP / \fBname\fP
Required. Absolute path in the filesystem where a given directory will be
bind mounted.
.TP
.B \fBfstype\fP
Optional. Specify the filesystem type to use with a given device. If not
specified, \fBnone\fP will be used, which is required for bind mounts.
.TP
.B \fBopts\fP
Optional. String (comma\-delimited) or YAML list of options for a given mount
point. If not specified, \fBbind\fP will be used instead.
.TP
.B \fBdump\fP
Optional. This field determines which filesystems should be backeed up by the
\fI\%dump(8)\fP <\fBhttps://manpages.debian.org/dump(8)\fP> command. If not specified, \fB0\fP is set by default.
.TP
.B \fBpassno\fP
Optional. This field determines the order of the filesystem checks on boot
done by the \fI\%fsck(8)\fP <\fBhttps://manpages.debian.org/fsck(8)\fP> command. The root filesystem should be it set to
