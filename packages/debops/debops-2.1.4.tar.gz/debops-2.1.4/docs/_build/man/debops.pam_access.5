.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fI\%Linux Pluggable Authentication Modules\fP <\fBhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_PAM\fP> provide dynamic authentication
support to services on Linux hosts. The \fBdebops.pam_access\fP role can be used
to manage one aspect of PAM \- access control rules that can be used to grant or
revoke access to services based on users, groups and origins.
.SH GETTING STARTED
.SS Default configuration
.sp
By default, the role does not configure any access rules in the
\fB/etc/security/access.conf\fP file. Control over this file is initialized
using a configuration entry named \fBglobal\fP\&. See the examples in the
pam_access__ref_rules for an explanation how to use it in the Ansible
inventory to set the access rules.
.sp
Role is designed to be used by other Ansible roles to manage their own access
lists, with a custom file per service. However, the rules defined via dependent
variables are not tracked outside of the context of a given role (ie. in
different playbooks), and roles cannot affect each other\(aqs access rules using
this method. Similarly, in Ansible inventory users should set the state of the
defined rules as \fBappend\fP, so that they don\(aqt clobber the existing rule files
when the debops.pam_access role is executed on its own, or via
a different playbook.
.sp
The activation of the \fBpam_access.so\fP PAM module for each service is not
managed by the debops.pam_access role itself, and should be managed by
the Ansible roles designed to configure the services.
.SS Example inventory
.sp
The debops.pam_access role is included in the DebOps common playbook,
therefore you don\(aqt need to do anything special to enable it on a host.
.SS Example playbook
.sp
If you are using this role without DebOps, here\(aqs an example Ansible playbook
that uses the \fBdebops.pam_access\fP role:

.SS Ansible tags
.sp
You can use Ansible \fB\-\-tags\fP or \fB\-\-skip\-tags\fP parameters to limit what
tasks are performed during Ansible run. This can be used after host is first
configured to speed up playbook execution, when you are sure that most of the
configuration has not been changed.
.sp
Available role tags:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBrole::pam_access\fP
Main role tag, should be used in the playbook to execute all of the role
tasks as well as role dependencies.

.SH DEFAULT VARIABLE DETAILS
.sp
Some of the \fBdebops.pam_access\fP default variables have more extensive
configuration than simple strings or lists, here you can find documentation and
examples for them.
.SS pam_access__rules
.sp
The \fBpam_access__*_rules\fP variables define the state of the
\fB/etc/security/access*.conf\fP configuration files and their contents.
The variables are merged in order defined by the
\fBpam_access__combined_rules\fP variable, which allows modification of the
default configuration through the Ansible inventory.
.SS Examples
.sp
Include some of the examples from the \fI\%access.conf(5)\fP <\fBhttps://manpages.debian.org/access.conf(5)\fP> manual page in the
global \fB/etc/security/access.conf\fP configuration file. Note that the
configuration is explicitly enabled because the role does not configure the
global access list by default:

Add some of the examples from the default \fB/etc/security/access.conf\fP
file installed by Debian to the \fB/etc/security/access\-sshd.conf\fP
configuration file used by the \fBsshd\fP service.
.sp
Note that the configuration has state \fBappend\fP which means that even though
the values are defined in the Ansible inventory, they will only be applied when
the debops.pam_access role is used in the context of the
debops.sshd role, via the \fBsshd.yml\fP playbook (the configuration entry
was defined elsewhere and inventory entry is appended to it). Otherwise the
custom access file used by the \fBsshd\fP service would be overwritten during
normal usage of the debops.pam_access role.
.sp
The examples are nonsensical in the context of the OpenSSH service, but are
provided here to show how to implement specific ACL rules.

.SS Syntax
.sp
The variables contain a list of YAML dictionaries, each dictionary can have
specific parameters:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBname\fP
Required. Name of an access control configuration file managed by the
debops.pam_access role. The role will create the file in:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/etc/security/access\-<name>.conf
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Configuration entries with the same \fBname\fP parameter will be merged
together in order of appearance; this can be used to modify existing entries
via the Ansible inventory.
.TP
.B \fBfilename\fP
Optional. Override the autogenerated file name. You should only specify the
filename itself, files are stored in the \fB/etc/security/\fP directory.
.TP
.B \fBstate\fP
Optional. If not specified or \fBpresent\fP, the configuration file will be
generated. If \fBabsent\fP, the specified configuration file will be removed.
If \fBinit\fP, the configuration entry will be initialized, but not active
\- this can be used to prepare an entry and activate it conditionally later.
If \fBignore\fP, a given configuration entry will not be evaluated by the role.
.sp
If \fBappend\fP, the configuration entry will be processed only if a given
entry was defined earlier. This should be a preferred method to modify access
rules defined by other Ansible roles through the Ansible inventory, otherwise
the user roles will override the role rules.
.TP
.B \fBdivert\fP
Optional, boolean. If \fBTrue\fP, the role will automatically divert or revert
the original access control rule file depending on its state, to preserve it
for APT upgrades. This parameter shouldn\(aqt be changed if a diverted file is
present, otherwise the role will not track the diversion.
.TP
.B \fBfieldsep\fP
Optional. Specify the character that will be used as the field separator in
the generated rule files. If not specified, colon (\fB:\fP) is used by default.
See \fI\%pam_access(8)\fP <\fBhttps://manpages.debian.org/pam_access(8)\fP> for information about the usage of this parameter.
.TP
.B \fBlistsep\fP
Optional. Specify the character that will be used as the list element
separator in the generated rule files. If not specified, space is used by
default. See \fI\%pam_access(8)\fP <\fBhttps://manpages.debian.org/pam_access(8)\fP> for information about the usage of this
parameter.
.TP
.B \fBoptions\fP
Required. List of YAML dictionaries which describe PAM access rules. The
lists in the entries with the same \fBname\fP parameter are merged together,
with the rules that use the same \fBname\fP affecting each other in order of
appearance. Rules can be defined using specific parameters:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBname\fP
Required. Name of a given access rule, not used directly. Entries with the
same \fBname\fP parameter will be merged together in order of appearance;
this allows modification of existing entries via Ansible inventory.
.TP
.B \fBpermission\fP
Required. Specify the permission of a given access rule. Possible values:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBallow\fP / \fB+\fP / \fBaccept\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBdeny\fP / \fB\-\fP / \fBdecline\fP
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBusers\fP
String or YAML list of usernames, netgroups or \fBALL\fP that matches
everyone. If \fBusers_except\fP parameter is specified, this parameter is
ignored.
.TP
.B \fBusers_except\fP
String or YAML list of usernames, netgroups or \fBALL\fP that matches
everyone. If this parameter is specified, the list of users or groups will
be prefixed with \fBALL EXCEPT\fP which allows for negation.
.TP
.B \fBgroups\fP
String or YAML list of UNIX group names, which will be automatically
wrapped in parentheses (\fB( )\fP) to mark them as groups. If
\fBgroups_except\fP parameter is specified, this parameter is ignored.
.TP
.B \fBgroups_except\fP
String or YAML list of UNIX group names, which will be automatically
wrapped in parentheses (\fB( )\fP) to mark them as groups. If this parameter
is specified, the list of users or groups will be prefixed with \fBALL
EXCEPT\fP which allows for negation.
.TP
.B \fBorigins\fP
String or YAML list of "origins" \- TTY names, hostnames, domain names
(specified with the \fB\&.\fP prefix), IP addresses, network addresses
(specified with the \fB\&.\fP suffix or with CIDR netmask), netgroup names,
\fBALL\fP which matches everything, or \fBLOCAL\fP which matches only local
TTYs and services. If \fBorigins_except\fP parameter is specified, this
parameter is ignored.
.TP
.B \fBorigins_except\fP
String or YAML list of "origins" \- TTY names, hostnames, domain names
(specified with the \fB\&.\fP prefix), IP addresses, network addresses
(specified with the \fB\&.\fP suffix or with CIDR netmask), netgroup names,
\fBALL\fP which matches everything, or \fBLOCAL\fP which matches only local
TTYs and services. If this parameter is specified, the list of origins will
be prefixed with \fBALL EXCEPT\fP which allows for negation.
.TP
.B \fBcomment\fP
Optional. String or YAML text block that contains comments about a given
access rule.
.TP
.B \fBstate\fP
Optional. If not specified or \fBpresent\fP, a given access rule will be
included in the generated rule file. If \fBabsent\fP, the rule will be
removed from the generated rule file.
.TP
.B \fBweight\fP
Optional. Positive or negative number, which can be used to affect the
position of the rule within the rule file. Positive numbers will force the
rule to be lower than normal (adding weight), negative numbers will move
the role higher on the list (substracting weight).
