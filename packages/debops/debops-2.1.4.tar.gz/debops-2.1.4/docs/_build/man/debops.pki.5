.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBdebops.pki\fP role provides a standardized management of the X.509
certificates on hosts controlled by Ansible. Other Ansible roles can utilize
the environment created by \fBdebops.pki\fP to automatically enable TLS/SSL
encrypted connections.
.sp
Using this role, you can bootstrap a Public Key Infrastructure in your
environment using an internal Certificate Authority, easily switch the active
set of certificates between internal and external Certificate Authorities, or
use the ACME protocol to automatically obtain certificates from CA that
support it (for example \fI\%Let\(aqs Encrypt\fP <\fBhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let's_Encrypt\fP>).
.SH GETTING STARTED
.SS Ansible Controller requirements
.sp
Some operations performed by the \fBdebops.pki\fP role are done on the Ansible
Controller. However, DebOps roles are not designed to manage the Ansible Controller
host directly, so they cannot automatically install the required software.
.sp
Software packages required by the role on the Ansible Controller:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
bash >= 4.3.0
openssl >= 1.0.1
.ft P

.SS Initial configuration
.sp
The default configuration of the \fBdebops.pki\fP role and the environment it creates
is designed to automatically provide valid X.509 certificates within the DebOps
cluster – a central Certificate Authority located on the Ansible Controller
automatically signs certificate requests from remote hosts, which are uploaded
by Ansible to the \fBsecret/\fP directory. Signed certificates are downloaded to
the remote hosts and automatically enabled, when necessary.
.sp
All of the remote hosts managed by DebOps will have the internal Root
Certificate Authority certificate installed in the system CA store. This will
ensure that the hosts within the cluster will automatically trust each other
and encrypted communication within the cluster should be possible without
further intervention.
.sp
Because of the nature of how X.509 certificates are created and maintained
(they cannot be "updated", per se, only new ones can be issued by the CA), it\(aqs
a good practice to create a test deployment of the PKI, and check if the
generated certificates are acceptable (correct Distinguished Name, certificate
validity times, etc.). There are some important role variables which might need
to be set in the inventory for best results.
.sp
Maintaining a secure Certificate Authority is a complicated process and to
ensure secure operation additional steps might be needed. You should read the
rest of the \fBdebops.pki\fP documentation to find out which parts of the created
environment are sensitive and require additional steps to ensure secure
operation.
.SS Useful global parameters
.sp
The environment managed by the \fBdebops.pki\fP role is distributed between the
Ansible Controller and remote hosts. Due to how task delegation in Ansible is
designed, some of the variables that are important for the operation of the
Ansible Controller are "sourced" on remote hosts. Therefore it\(aqs a good
practice to define them in the Ansible inventory \fBall\fP group (usually
\fBansible/inventory/group_vars/all/pki.yml\fP) for consistency between different
remote hosts.
.sp
Most of these variables are related to Certificate Authority operation, the
ones you will likely want to change are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBpki_ca_domain\fP
This is the DNS domain used as a base for the internal Certificate Authority
Distinguished Names. If you use more than one domain in your environment, you
should set this variable to your preferred domain on all hosts, through
Ansible\(aqs inventory.
.sp
If you use VPS hosts provided by an external organization, they might be
configured with no default domain, or the provider domain might be set up by
default. Make sure that you check what domain is used by your remote hosts.
.TP
.B \fBpki_ca_organization\fP
This is the organizations name used as a base for the internal
Certificate Authority Distinguished Names.
.TP
.B \fBpki_ca_root_dn\fP, \fBpki_ca_domain_dn\fP, \fBpki_ca_service_dn\fP
These variables define the Distinguished Name or Subject of the Root
Certificate Authority and Domain Certificate Authority. The value is a list
of DN entries which define the subject.
.TP
.B \fBpki_authorities\fP
This is the list of internal Certificate Authorities managed on an Ansible
Controller.
.sp
\fBdebops.pki\fP now supports the X.509 Name Constraints certificate extension by
default. This may break software using old version of OpenSSL and multi\-domain
environments. Please see \fBname_constraints\fP and \fBname_constraints_critical\fP
under pki__ref_authorities for more information.
.UNINDENT
.SS Example inventory
.sp
In DebOps, the \fBdebops.pki\fP role is included in the \fBcommon.yml\fP playbook
and is run automatically on all of the managed hosts. You don\(aqt need to
specifically enable it in Ansible\(aqs inventory.
.SS Example playbook
.sp
The \fBdebops.pki\fP role requires a specialized Ansible playbook for correct
operation. Additional directories required by the role are created in the
\fBsecret/\fP directory on Ansible Controller, and this requires use of the
special \fBdebops.pki/env\fP role provided within the main role.

.SH PKI REALMS STRUCTURE
.sp
The concept of PKI realms is designed to provide a standardized way for various
applications to access X.509 certificates and private keys. The management of
the keys and certificates is moved outside of the application into a fixed
directory and file structure, which other applications can access.
.SS PKI realm overview
.sp
A "PKI realm" is a placeholder name for a bundle of the private key, X.509
certificate and Root CA certificate. This bundle has a certain directory
structure, rules for naming files and what symlinks are present. It is designed
so that from the outside of the debops.pki role other Ansible roles, or
services they manage, have a standardized, uniform location where they can find
X.509 certificates and private keys.
.sp
In different guides that describe setting up TLS for different services like
webservers, mail servers, databases, etc.  the private keys and X.509
certificates are usually put in different directories \- for example
\fB/etc/nginx/ssl/\fP, \fB/etc/postfix/certs/\fP, \fB/etc/ssl/certs/\fP,
and so on. The debops.pki role turns this around by setting up an
uniform set of directories split into "PKI realms", so that a host can have
multiple sets of certificates, each for different purposes. Then, various
services can be configured to get the private key and certificate files from
those specific directories, including privileged access to the private keys
when needed.
.sp
PKI realms have a concept of multiple certificate authorities \- there\(aqs one set
of private keys which can be signed by different CAs \- internal CA, external
CA, ACME CA and self\-signed when everything else is disabled. There can be an
"example.org" PKI realm which has certificates signed by both internal CA and
the Let\(aqs Encrypt CA (via ACME), and the \fBpki\-realm\fP script used to
manage the realms on the remote hosts will automatically switch between them
after checking the validity of their X.509 certificates.
.SS The application view
.sp
Different applications have different requirements for X.509 certificates and
private keys. Some of them support keys and certificates in separate files,
others require them combined in a single file. The PKI realm is designed to
support both schemes at once.
.sp
The realms are located in the \fB/etc/pki/realms/\fP directory. Each realm is
contained in it\(aqs own subdirectory. By default a \fBdomain\fP realm is configured
by the role, and it\(aqs simplified directory structure looks like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/etc/pki/realms/
└── domain/
    ├── CA.crt
    ├── default.crt
    ├── default.key
    ├── default.pem
    └── trusted.crt
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Each of these symlinks point to a file contained in another subdirectory (see
the next section). The contents of these files are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBCA.crt\fP
This is the "trust anchor" or Root Certificate Authority certificate used by
the application to check the validity of client certificates. This file is
publicly readable.
.sp
\fBCA.crt\fP may contain a CA certificate different than the one that issued
the server certificate. In this case, this can be used to have separate
client and server Certificate Authorities.
.TP
.B \fBdefault.crt\fP
This is the server certificate with optionally bundled Intermediate
Certificate Authorities. It is sent to the clients during connection
establishment by the application. This file is publicly readable.
.TP
.B \fBdefault.key\fP
This is the server private key. It\(aqs readable only by the \fBroot\fP account
and by \fBpki_private_group\fP – this can be used to limit access to
different private keys by different UNIX accounts.
.TP
.B \fBdefault.pem\fP
This file contains the private key, server certificate and Intermediate
CA certificate(s). It has the same restrictions as the private key – can be
read only by the \fBroot\fP account and by \fBpki_private_group\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBtrusted.crt\fP
This is the complete trust chain of intermediate and root CA certificates,
without the server certificate, similar to \fBCA.crt\fP\&. It is used for
automatic OCSP stapling verification by the server, and works with the
primary CA in case the alternative Certificate Authority is used for client
certificates.
.UNINDENT
.sp
All of the above filenames are static, which means that the only thing you need
to change to select a different PKI realm is the realm directory name.
.SS Example nginx configuration
.sp
To use the \fBdomain\fP realm in your \fBnginx\fP configuration, you can add
something similar to this example in your configuration file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
server {
    listen [::]:443 ssl;

    # HTTPS support
    ssl_certificate         /etc/pki/realms/domain/default.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key     /etc/pki/realms/domain/default.key;

    # OCSP Stapling support
    ssl_stapling            on;
    ssl_stapling_verify     on;
    ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/pki/realms/domain/trusted.crt;

    # X.509 Client certificate support
    ssl_verify_client       optional;
    ssl_verify_depth        2;
    ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/pki/realms/domain/CA.crt;
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This configuration explains where each certificate is used, but this is not
sufficient to enable HTTPS for the webserver. Refer to the \fBnginx\fP
documentation for the rest of the required configuration options.
.sp
If you use the \fBdebops.nginx\fP Ansible role provided with the project, it has
extensive integration with the \fBdebops.pki\fP role and can configure the
webserver automatically. Usually all you need to do is to make sure the default
realm matches the one you would like to use for each server configuration.
.SS The PKI realm directory structure
.sp
This is an example \fBdomain\fP realm directory, created on each remote host
managed by \fBdebops.pki\fP\&. The current set of certificates active in this realm
is provided by the internal \fBdebops.pki\fP Certificate Authority:

Your version might not contain all of the shown files and symlinks, for example
the \fBalt_*.pem\fP versions of intermediate and root CA certificates are only
present if an alternative CA is configured.
.sp
Both directories are maintained and kept in sync using two Bash scripts
provided by the role, \fBpki\-realm\fP and \fBpki\-authority\fP\&. Ansible tasks are
used to copy files to and from Ansible Controller to remote hosts.
.SS How a PKI realm is created
.sp
Each PKI realm starts with a simple directory structure created on the Ansible
Controller in the \fBsecret/\fP directory:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
secret/pki/
└── realms/
 \ \  ├── by\-group/
 \ \  │\ \  └── all/

 \ \          └── domain/
 \ \              ├── external/

 \ \              └── private/
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
These directories are created at the beginning, so that Ansible can copy
private files before the actual PKI realm creation on remote hosts. This can be
used to provide a set of identical private RSA keys to multiple hosts at once
(using the directories in \fBprivate/\fP subdirectories) or custom scripts that
access external Certificate Authorities (using \fBexternal/\fP subdirectories).
.sp
Next, PKI realm directories are created on the remote host:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/etc/pki/realms/
└── domain/
    ├── acme/
    ├── config/
    │\ \  └── realm.conf
    ├── external/
    ├── internal/
    ├── private/
    └── public/
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBconfig/realm.conf\fP file contains a set of Bash variables that define
different parameters of the PKI realm, for example the default DNS domain used
to generate the certificates, owner and group of various directories and files,
permissions applied to various directory and file types, and so on.
.sp
The \fBacme/\fP, \fBexternal/\fP and \fBinternal/\fP subdirectories hold
data files for different Certificate Authorities. Each CA is described in more
detail in a separate document, here is a brief overview:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBacme/\fP
This directory is for certificates issued using \fI\%ACME\fP <\fBhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Certificate_Management_Environment\fP> (for example \fI\%Let\(aqs Encrypt\fP <\fBhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let's_Encrypt\fP>).
It will be activated and used automatically when a host has a public IP address
and the \fBnginx\fP webserver is installed and configured to support ACME
Challenges (see the \fI\%debops.nginx\fP <\fBhttps://github.com/debops/ansible-nginx\fP> role for more details).
.TP
.B \fBexternal/\fP
This directory is used to manage certificates signed by an external
Certificate Authority. To do this, you need to provide a special \fBscript\fP
file, which will be executed with a set of environment variables. This can be
used to request a certificate from an external CA, like Active Directory or
FreeIPA, or download a certificate from an external location.
.sp
An alternative is to provide an already signed \fBcert.pem\fP file and
optionally the \fBintermediate.pem\fP and \fBroot.pem\fP files.
.TP
.B \fBinternal/\fP
This directory is used by the internal \fBdebops.pki\fP Certificate Authority
to transfer certificate requests as well as certificates.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the internal CA is disabled either globally for a host, or for a particular
PKI realm, an alternative directory, \fBselfsigned/\fP will be created. It
will hold a self\-signed certificate, not trusted by anything else (not even the
host that has created it). This is done, so that services depending on the
existence of the private keys and certificates can function correctly at all
times.
.sp
The \fBpki\-realm\fP script, located in \fB/usr/local/lib/pki\fP on
remote hosts, checks which of these directories have valid
certificates in order of \fBpki_authority_preference\fP, and the first
valid one is used as the "active" directory.  Files from the active directory
are symlinked to the \fBpublic/\fP directory.
.sp
The \fBpublic/\fP directory holds the currently active certificates which are
symlinks to the real certificate files in one of the active directories mentioned above.
Some additional files are also created here by the \fBpki\-realm\fP script, namely
the certificate chain (server certificate + intermediate certificates) and the
trusted chain (intermediate certificates + root certificate). The full
certificate contains server certificate + intermediate certificates + root
certificate, which might be required by some applications.
.sp
The \fBprivate/\fP directory holds the private key of a given realm. Access to
this directory and files inside is restricted by UNIX permissions and only
a specific system group (usually \fBssl\-cert\fP, but it can be configured) is
allowed to access the files inside.
.sp
The next step is the creation of all necessary files, like private/public keys,
certificate requests, etc. At this point, if Ansible was provided with a
private RSA key to use, it will copy it to the \fBprivate/\fP directory.
After that, all necessary files are created by the \fBpki\-realm\fP script
on the remote host. The directory structure changes a bit:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

As you can see, the configuration of a Certificate Request for an internal CA
has been created, and the \fBinternal/request.pem\fP file has been generated,
using the \fBprivate/key.pem\fP RSA key. By default, if no \fBroot.pem\fP
certificate is provided, the system CA certificate store is symlinked as
\fBCA.crt\fP\&.
.sp
Afterwards, Ansible uploads the generated \fI\%Certificate Signing Request\fP <\fBhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_signing_request\fP> (\fI\%CSR\fP <\fBhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_signing_request\fP>) to
the Ansible Controller for the internal CA to sign (if it\(aqs enabled). The CSR is
uploaded to the \fBsecret/\fP directory:

To avoid possible confusion, the \fBsecret/pki/requests/domain/\fP directory
points to the "domain" internal CA which is an intermediate CA located under
the "root" CA. The \fBhostname.example.com/domain/\fP directory inside the
\fBdomain/\fP directory points to the "domain" realm on the
\fBhostname.example.com\fP host.
.sp
When all of the requests from the remote hosts are uploaded to the Ansible
Controller, the \fBpki\-authority\fP script inside the \fBsecret/lib\fP directory takes
over and performs certificate signing for all of the currently managed hosts.
The certificate named \fBcert.pem\fP is placed in the \fBinternal/\fP
directory of each host according to the realm the request came from.
.sp
In addition to the certificates, the CA intermediate and root certificates are
also symlinked to the \fBinternal/\fP directory, so that Ansible can
automatically copy their contents to the remote hosts. If a particular
Certificate Authority indicates that an alternative CA should be present, the
\fBalt_*.pem\fP versions of intermediate and root certificates are also symlinked
there:

When all of the requests have been processed, Ansible copies the content of the
directories to remote hosts. The content of the \fBby\-host/\fP directory is copied
first and overwrites all files that are present on remote hosts, the
\fBby\-group/\fP directory content is copied only when the corresponding files
are not present. This allows the administrator to provide the shared scripts or
private keys/certificates as needed, per host, per group or for all managed
hosts.
.sp
After certificates signed by the internal CA are downloaded to remote hosts,
the directory structure might look similar to:

Other authority directories (\fBacme/\fP and \fBexternal/\fP) might also
contain various files.
.sp
After certificates are copied from the Ansible Controller, the
\fBpki\-realm\fP script is executed again for each PKI realm configured on
a given host. It checks which authority directories have valid
certificates, picks the first viable one according to
\fBpki_authority_preference\fP and activates them.
.sp
Certificate activation entails symlinking the certificate, intermediate and
root files to the \fBpublic/\fP directory and generation of various chain files:
certificate + intermediate, intermediate + root and key + certificate
+ intermediate (which is stored securely in the \fBprivate/\fP directory).
.sp
Some applications do not support a separate \fBdhparam\fP file, and instead expect
that the DHE parameters are present after the X.509 certificate chain. If the
\fI\%debops.dhparam\fP <\fBhttps://github.com/debops/ansible-dhparam\fP> role has been configured on a host and Diffie\-Hellman
parameter support is enabled in a given PKI realm, DHE parameters will be
appended to the final certificate chains (both public and private). When
\fI\%debops.dhparam\fP <\fBhttps://github.com/debops/ansible-dhparam\fP> regenerates the parameters, the \fBpki\-realm\fP script will
automatically detect the new ones and update the certificate chains.
.sp
The end result is a fully configured PKI realm with a set of valid certificates
available for other applications and services:

During this process, at various stages special "hook" scripts might be run,
which can react to events like realm creation, activation of new certificates
and so on.
.SH INTERNAL CERTIFICATE AUTHORITIES
.sp
One of the problems in the deployment of a Public Key Infrastructure is the need
for the certificates to be signed by a third party, called a Certificate
Authority. By using a trusted CA, different entities that communicate with each
other can ensure that certificates in use are valid and genuine. A common
solution to that problem is the creation of a "self\-signed certificate" which can
be used by various applications as any other certificate. Unfortunately, this
is not a sufficient way to ensure validity of a given certificate in
a distributed environment, where various services need to ensure trust without
a human intervention because other nodes in the cluster don’t trust the
self\-signed certificate.
.sp
There are various solutions that let you set up a Certificate Authority which
then can use an automated API to receive Certificate Signing Requests and issue
certificates, however there always is an issue of bootstrapping such
a solution. To ensure that the communication between requesting host and the CA
is confidential, you need to provide the service over HTTPS, which requires
a set of certificates, which require a CA, and so on, and so forth. An
alternative is to request a certificate in an already existing Certificate
Authority and configure them manually on your own CA server, however this
requires human interaction. A proposed solution to this problem is ACME, used
for example by the \fILet\(aqs Encrypt\fP, however this solution cannot be used
with internal hosts, which still need to be protected.
.sp
The \fBdebops.pki\fP role solves this problem by creating it\(aqs own set of internal
Certificate Authorities, located on the Ansible Controller in the \fBsecret/\fP
directory (see debops.secret for more details). These Certificate
Authorities can be used to bootstrap a new PKI environment, which can then be
passed over to a stand\-alone CA server located on the network. Alternatively,
certificates signed by the internal CA can be used for internal communication
between hosts in the cluster, and external certificates can be enabled for
public services like websites or mail servers.
.SS Layout of Certificate Authorities
.sp
By default, the \fBdebops.pki\fP role creates two Certificate Authorities:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
a Root Certificate Authority which is used as the "trust anchor" by
intermediate Certificate Authorities;
.IP \(bu 2
a Domain Certificate Authority which issues certificates based on incoming
CSRs from remote hosts;

The incoming certificate requests are placed in subdirectories of the
\fBsecret/pki/requests/\fP directory. Each subdirectory is related to
a Certificate Authority, on above directory tree you can see that a request has
been uploaded from \fBhostname.example.com\fP host for the \fBdomain\fP Certificate
Authority.
.sp
The certificates are placed in subdirectories of the \fBsecret/pki/realms/\fP
directory. The intermediate CA certificate and root CA certificate files are
symlinked in the same subdirectory as the leaf certificate, so that Ansible can copy
their contents as regular files to remote host and correct certificate chains
can be created in the PKI realm.
.SS Security of an internal CA
.sp
The Certificate Authority is a very vulnerable element of the Private Key
Infrastructure. Hosts that have a Root CA certificate in their system
certificate store will trust any certificates signed by that CA and it\(aqs
intermediate Certificate Authorities, therefore protection of the Root CA
private key should be taken care of as soon as possible.
.sp
The default Root Certificate Authority private key can be found in:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
secret/pki/authorities/root/private/key.pem
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This key allows you to create new Intermediate Certificate Authorities as well
as revoke existing ones (although enforcement of the revocation in the form or
distribution of Certificate Revocation Lists or an OCSP service is not
currently implemented). You should protect access to it by moving the file to
a secure location (preferably an encrypted, offline filesystem) and replacing
it with an empty \fBkey.pem\fP file (otherwise the \fBdebops.pki\fP role will
replace the private key and regenerate all of the CA certificates).
.sp
Unfortunately, private keys of the Domain Certificate Authority and any other
Intermediate Certificate Authority or "Service CA", which is a Root CA used
to sign service certificates cannot be protected by taking them offline \- the
private keys are required to sign certificates. Therefore, it is strongly
recommended to store the \fBsecret/\fP directory encrypted, and use it on an
encrypted filesystem during use. In DebOps, you can use the EncFS filesystem
together with the \fBdebops\-padlock\fP script to keep the \fBsecret/\fP directory
encrypted at rest. You should make sure that access to the plaintext files in
\fBsecret/\fP is only possible when it is really needed by unmounting the
encrypted filesystem as soon as possible after usage and that only programs
which need access can read the files by setting up restrictions like \fI\%Mandatory
Access Control\fP <\fBhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_access_control\fP> and compartmentalization/sandboxing, to avoid leakage of
private keys.
.sp
The Certificate Signing Requests created by \fBdebops.pki\fP Ansible role contain
a random challenge password (different on each run) which is then checked on
the Ansible Controller, and only the CSR with correct passwords are signed by the
Certificate Authorities. This should prevent signing of Certificate Signing
Requests modified by a third party, unless the challenge password can be
intercepted (it\(aqs currently passed using environment variables).
.sp
If for any reason CSR signing cannot be completed, you will need to remove the
\fBinternal/gnutls.conf\fP and \fBinternal/request.pem\fP files on remote
hosts to re\-initialize the certificate signing.
.SH ACME INTEGRATION
.sp
\fIAutomated Certificate Management Environment\fP (\fI\%ACME\fP <\fBhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Certificate_Management_Environment\fP>) is a protocol that
allows automated certificate requests, retrieval of certificates and
certificate renewal. It was designed to enable easy deployment of X.509
certificates from \fI\%Let\(aqs Encrypt\fP <\fBhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let's_Encrypt\fP>\&.
.sp
The \fBdebops.pki\fP Ansible role provides support for the ACMEv2 protocol which
is used by default with the Let\(aqs Encrypt (there is a possibility to integrate
other similar services in the future). Interaction with the ACME Certificate
Authority is performed using the \fI\%acme\-tiny\fP <\fBhttps://github.com/diafygi/acme-tiny\fP> alternative client written in
Python.
.SS Prerequisites
.sp
To request and renew ACME certificates, a host needs to meet several
requirements enforced by this Ansible role:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
A webserver configured to handle ACME challenges needs to be installed on the
host (currently this role supports only \fBhttp\-01\fP challenges). The
\fI\%debops.nginx\fP <\fBhttps://github.com/debops/ansible-nginx\fP> role configures ACME support for all servers by default when
other conditions are met.
.IP \(bu 2
A publicly routable IPv4 or IPv6 address is required, so that the Certificate
Authority can contact the webserver and check the challenge responses. The
\fBdebops.pki\fP role detects if a suitable IP address is present, and disables
the ACME support otherwise. This can be overridden if necessary for example to
allow ACME on an internal server which can handle challenges forwarded
through the gateway.
.IP \(bu 2
Each domain or subdomain requested in a particular certificate needs to be
correctly configured in the DNS to point to the host that requests the
certificate. This is currently not done automatically and requires
intervention by the administrator. If any domain specified in the request is
not authorized by the correct ACME challenge, the certificate request won\(aqt be
successful.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Due to above requirements, the default \fBdomain\fP PKI realm configured by the
role does not request ACME certificates automatically. Other realms created by
the \fBdebops.pki\fP role might have ACME support enabled, depending on presence
of a public IP address and a configured \fBnginx\fP server.
.SS Let\(aqs Encrypt rate limits
.sp
The Let\(aqs Encrypt ACME Certificate Authority has
\fI\%different rate limits\fP <\fBhttps://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/\fP>
related to the number of certificate requests and the number of domains permitted per
certificate.
.sp
To avoid triggering the limits too quickly due to a mistake, \fBdebops.pki\fP
disables the requests when the \fBacme/error.log\fP file is present in the PKI
realm directory. You can check contents of this file to find out what might be
the issue, and after fixing it you need to remove the file to let the
\fBpki\-realm\fP script make the request again.
.SS How ACME certificates are managed
.sp
When a new PKI realm is created and support for ACME Certificate Authority is
enabled, a separate configuration for a Certificate Request will be created in
the \fBacme/\fP directory. This request does not use a wildcard certificate;
instead the default domain and a set of subdomains will be requested (see below
for configuration variables). The directory structure at this time looks like
this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.sp
When the \fBpki\-realm\fP detects the \fBacme/request.pem\fP file, it
automatically calls the \fBacme\-tiny\fP script using the \fBpki\-acme\fP
unprivileged account to request the certificate. When the request has completed
successfully and an \fBexternal/cert.pem\fP certificate is found, the
certificate will be activated in the \fBpublic/\fP directory. The script
automatically downloads Let\(aqs Encrypt intermediate certificate as well as links
the Root CA certificate from the system certificate store provided by the
\fBca\-certificates\fP package.

If the request is not successful, you will find a \fBacme/error.log\fP file with
log of the \fBacme\-tiny\fP session. Check and fix the issue, and remove the log
file to re\-enable the process again. Otherwise, \fBpki\-realm\fP will not request
the certificates to avoid rate limit issues explained above.
.SS Certificate renewal
.sp
The \fBdebops.pki\fP role creates a \fBcron\fP entry for the \fBpki\-realm\fP script
to be executed periodically for all realms. When a realm has the ACME
configuration active, it will check for validity of the certificate, and
about a month before the expiration date it will try to renew the certificate
automatically.
.SS Example: Certificate for apex domain and subdomains
.sp
The \fIapex domain\fP is the "root" level of your domain.
In this example a X.509 certificate for the apex domain \fBexample.com\fP is
going to be issued. \fBexample.com\fP will be listed in the certificate
\fBSubject\fP DN.
The certificate will also be valid for the subdomains \fBwww.example.com\fP,
\fBblog.example.com\fP and \fBmail.example.com\fP which are included in the
certificate as \fI\%Subject Alternative Names\fP <\fBhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubjectAltName\fP>\&.

limits in the production environment. When you are sure that everything works
correctly, comment the staging environment out again to get yourself a valid
and trusted X.509 certificate.
.SS Example: Certificate for subdomains excluding the apex domain

.SS ACME configuration variables

The \fBdebops.pki\fP role has several default variables which can be used to
control ACME support. The most important are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBpki_acme\fP
Boolean. When \fBTrue\fP, support for ACME Certificate Authority will be
configured for all PKI realms unless disabled on the realm level. By default
the role checks if a public IP address is available and a default domain is
configured, otherwise the support is disabled automatically.
.TP
.B \fBpki_acme_install\fP
Boolean. Enable or disable installation of \fBacme\-tiny\fP and configuration of
ACME support without enabling it for all realms. When this variable is set to
\fBTrue\fP and \fBpki_acme\fP is set to \fBFalse\fP, ACME support can be enabled
independently in each PKI realm. By default, it is set to the same value as
\fBpki_acme\fP\&.

.B \fBpki_acme_ca\fP
Name of the ACME Certificate Authority API endpoint to use. Dictionary with
endpoints is defined in the \fBpki_acme_ca_api_map\fP variable. By
default, \fBle\-live\-v2\fP is used which points to the Let\(aqs Encrypt Live CA.

.SH EXTERNAL CERTIFICATES
.sp
The PKI realms managed by the \fBdebops.pki\fP role support management of private
keys and certificates from external Certificate Authorities. You can either
provide a set of valid certificates with corresponding private keys,
or use a script with a custom environment to request a certificate remotely from
an external Certificate Authority.
.SS Required files
.sp
For the \fBpki\-realm\fP script to correctly recognize and enable external
certificates, you need to provide a set of specific files, either statically
through the \fBsecret/\fP directory or by creating them using a script (see
below). All paths are relative to the main PKI realm directory, for example
\fB/etc/pki/realms/example.com/\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBprivate/key.pem\fP
Private key used by a specific PKI realm. If not present, the \fBpki\-realm\fP
script will generate one automatically before executing the external script.
.TP
.B \fBexternal/cert.pem\fP
Required. The certificate signed by an external Certificate Authority, in PEM
format.
.TP
.B \fBexternal/intermediate.pem\fP
Set of intermediate CA certificates which signed the realm certificate. They
will be chained together with the realm certificate automatically.
.TP
.B \fBexternal/root.pem\fP
The certificate of the Root Certificate Authority. It will be chained with
the intermediate CA certificates for OCSP stapling purposes.
.TP
.B \fBexternal/script\fP
A custom script (any language should work, however you need to take care of
additional dependencies) which will be executed on the remote host if found,
with a set of environment variables. The script will be executed inside the
\fBexternal/\fP directory of a given realm.
.UNINDENT
.SS Static private keys and certificates
.sp
When the \fBdebops.pki\fP Ansible role is run, it creates a set of directories on
the Ansible Controller in the \fBsecret/\fP directory:

As you can see, the directory structure reflects the Ansible inventory model:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBrealms/by\-group/all/\fP \-> \fBinventory/group_vars/all/\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBrealms/by\-group/inventory_group/\fP \-> \fBinventory/group_vars/inventory_group/\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBrealms/by\-host/hostname.example.com/\fP \-> \fBinventory/host_vars/hostname.example.com/\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
Each of those directories has a set of subdirectories for configured PKI
realms, with the \fBexternal/\fP, \fBinternal/\fP and \fBprivate/\fP directories
corresponding to the same ones on the remote hosts. Ansible at different stages
of the \fBdebops.pki\fP role run will copy contents of these directories to
remote hosts, in a specific order:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
contents of the \fBrealms/by\-host/<hostname>\fP directories for each host
will be copied and overwrite already present files;
.IP \(bu 2
contents of the \fBrealms/by\-group/<group_name>/\fP directories will be
copied next, but will not overwrite already existing files. Only hosts that
are in a given inventory group will receive the corresponding files;
.IP \(bu 2
and finally, contents of the \fBrealms/by\-group/all/\fP directory will be
copied to all currently managed remote hosts, but won\(aqt overwrite already
present files;
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can use this to distribute already issued certificates with their private
keys. Putting them in \fBrealms/by\-group/all/\fP directory will ensure that all
hosts will have the same set of keys and certificates. If you put them in
a specific group directory, only hosts in that group will receive the files.
Files put in a specific host directory will only be copied to that host.
.sp
The private keys will be copied to remote hosts before the PKI realm is
created, which means that any potential ACME or internal certificates will use
them instead of automatically generated ones. This might be useful if you need
to have several hosts which use the same set of private keys.
.sp
The above mechanism is used to distribute certificates from internal
Certificate Authorities, using the \fBinternal/\fP directory.
.sp
Because files copied from \fBby\-group/all/\fP and \fBby\-group/inventory_group/\fP
directories are not overwritten automatically, you will need to remove the
corresponding files on remote hosts yourself if you want to update them.
.sp
The \fBpki_inventory_groups\fP default variable is a list of Ansible inventory
groups that will have their corresponding directories. You need to specify your
custom inventory groups in order to have them "active".
.SS Certificates managed by a custom script
.sp
You can create a custom script and store it in above directories as
\fBexternal/script\fP (permissions are not important). It will be copied to
the remote host, made executable and run by the \fBpki\-realm\fP script with the
\fBexternal/\fP directory as the current working directory. You can use this
to provide additional files needed by the Certificate Authority. The expected
output of the script is a set of files mentioned above.
.sp
The script will be executed under the \fBroot\fP account, with a set of
\fB$PKI_SCRIPT_*\fP environment variables:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB$PKI_SCRIPT_REALM\fP
Contains the name of the current PKI realm, set in \fBitem.name\fP parameter.
.TP
.B \fB$PKI_SCRIPT_FQDN\fP
Contains Fully Qualified Domain Name used as the default domain if the realm
does not specify one in it\(aqs name.
.TP
.B \fB$PKI_SCRIPT_SUBJECT\fP
Contains the Distinguished Name, or subject of the certificate, each element
separated by the \fB/\fP character, similar to the format of the \fBopenssl req
\-subj\fP option.
.TP
.B \fB$PKI_SCRIPT_DOMAINS\fP
List of apex (root) domains configured for the realm, separated by the \fB/\fP
character.
.TP
.B \fB$PKI_SCRIPT_SUBDOMAINS\fP
List of subdomains which should be added to each apex domain, each one
separated by the \fB/\fP character. The special \fB_wildcard_\fP name means
a wildcard subdomain (\fB*.example.com\fP).
.TP
.B \fB$PKI_SCRIPT_PRIVATE_KEY\fP
Absolute path to the private key of the current PKI realm.
.TP
.B \fB$PKI_SCRIPT_DEFAULT_CRT\fP
Absolute path to the current PKI realm certificate chain, expected to be used
in the application configuration files.
.TP
.B \fB$PKI_SCRIPT_DEFAULT_KEY\fP
Absolute path to the current PKI realm private key, expected to be used in
the application configuration files.
.TP
.B \fB$PKI_SCRIPT_DEFAULT_PEM\fP
Absolute path to the current PKI realm combined private key and certificate
chain, expected to be used in the application configuration files.
.TP
.B \fB$PKI_SCRIPT_STATE\fP
A list of PKI realm states separated by the \fB,\fP character. You can inspect
this variable to determine the current state of the current realm
(initialization, activation of new certificates, changed files) and react to
it in the script.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Because the operation of the PKI realm is stateless, the external script will be
executed multiple times during \fBdebops.pki\fP run. The state in which the realm
is in will be present in the \fB$PKI_SCRIPT_STATE\fP variable and using that you can
perform various operations, like issuing a new certificate request when the
realm is created.
.SH SYSTEM CA CERTIFICATES
.sp
On Debian GNU/Linux and it\(aqs derivative distributions, management of Root
Certificate Authority certificates is performed by the \fBca\-certificates\fP
package. This package maintains a list of active Root CA certificates in the
\fB/etc/ca\-certificates.conf\fP configuration file, and stores the certificates
themselves in the \fB/etc/ssl/certs/\fP directory.
.sp
The \fBdebops.pki\fP role has several variables which can be used to control what
Root Certificate Authorities are trusted by the system, as well as supports
easy installation of local or custom Root Certificate Authorities.
.SS Configuration of system CA certificates
.sp
The \fB/etc/ca\-certificates.conf\fP configuration file specifies which
certificates will be trusted by the system. This is done by specifying names of
certificate files located in the \fB/usr/share/ca\-certificates/\fP directory.
The specified certificate files will be included in the system CA store. If a
given filename is prefixed with \fB!\fP, a given certificate will be excluded
from the system CA store.
.sp
By default, Debian hosts automatically trust new Root Certificate Authorities
added in the \fBca\-certificates\fP package. To control this, you can use
\fBpki_system_ca_certificates_trust_new\fP boolean variable. Setting this
variable to \fBTrue\fP will ensure that new Root CA certificates are trusted.
Setting it to \fBFalse\fP will not enable new CA certificates automatically.
.sp
You can use \fBpki_system_ca_certificates_blacklist\fP and
\fBpki_system_ca_certificates_whitelist\fP list variables to define which
certificates will be excluded/included in the CA store. Each list element is
a regexp of the certificate file name. If a given file is found in both lists,
it will be excluded from the certificate store.
.sp
To find out the names of the certificate files you can use, check the contents
of the \fB/etc/ca\-certificates.conf\fP configuration file.

.SS Local Root CA certificates
.sp
Contents of the \fBsecret/pki/ca\-certificates/\fP directory located on the
Ansible Controller will be copied to all of the remote hosts by the
\fBdebops.pki\fP role, to the \fB/usr/local/share/ca\-certificates/pki/\fP
directory. After that, they will be automatically added to the system Root CA
store using the \fBupdate\-ca\-certificates\fP script.
.sp
Note that already present CA certificates on remote hosts with the same name
are not updated after the first download unless the CA certificates are by
host.
.sp
The internal Root Certificate Authorities created by the \fBdebops.pki\fP role
will have their certificates automatically symlinked in the
\fBsecret/pki/ca\-certificates/\fP directory. You can prevent that by adding an
\fBitem.system_ca: False\fP parameter in the CA configuration variable.
.SH CUSTOM FILE MANAGEMENT
.sp
If you need to, you can copy custom files or even create files with content in
YAML templates using a set of list variables. You can use this feature to
install private keys and certificates stored as YAML text blocks in a file
encrypted with \fBansible\-vault\fP which is unlocked during Ansible run.
.sp
Each element of the file list is a dict with specific parameters:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBsrc\fP
Required, unless \fBcontent\fP is specified. Path to a file on the Ansible
Controller, which will be copied to the remote host.
.TP
.B \fBcontent\fP
Required, unless \fBsrc\fP is specified. A YAML text block or a Jinja variable,
contents of which will be copied to the specified file on the remote host.
.TP
.B \fBdest\fP
Required. Path to the destination file on the remote host.
.TP
.B \fBowner\fP
Owner of the created file, by default \fBroot\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBgroup\fP
File group, depending on the file type it will be \fBroot\fP (for public files)
or a group specified by the \fBpki_private_group\fP variable, usually
\fBssl\-cert\fP (for private files).
.TP
.B \fBmode\fP
File permissions, by default public files are copied with permissions \fB644\fP
and private files will have \fB640\fP permissions.
.TP
.B \fBforce\fP
Boolean. If \fBTrue\fP (default), an existing file will be replaced with the
specified file or contents.
.UNINDENT
.sp
There are multiple list variables which can be used on multiple inventory
levels:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
all hosts in the inventory:
\- \fBpki_private_files\fP
\- \fBpki_public_files\fP
.IP \(bu 2

.sp
The set of \fBpki_realms\fP lists can be used to define the configuration of PKI
realms located on remote hosts. Each realm keeps a set of private keys and
certificates which are signed by the various Certificate Authorities.
.sp
Each entry is a dictionary variable with specific parameters. Most of the
parameters are optional, and if they are not specified, the \fBpki\-realm\fP
script that manages the PKI realms should pick the correct options by itself.
.sp
List of parameters related to the entire PKI realm:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBname\fP
Required. This is the name of the PKI realm, used as the name of the
directory which contains the realm subdirectories, by default stored in
the \fB/etc/pki/realms/\fP directory. The \fBname\fP parameter is interpreted
by the role in various ways:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
the single string name, like "domain", "xxxxaaaayyyy" or similar strings.
These PKI realm names can be thought of as "handles" and they don\(aqt have any
impact on the domains stored in the X.509 certificates. The role will
by default use the host\(aqs FQDN and DNS domain name to generate such realms,
but it can be overridden. Users can create multiple such PKI realms for
various purposes.
.IP \(bu 2
the DNS\-based name, which contains dots, like "example.com",
"host.example.com" and the like. These PKI realms base their X.509 certificates
after the realm name by default. This is also the reason the default PKI realm
is named "domain" and not "{{ ansible_domain }}" \- users can create a new PKI
realm for their default DNS domain on hosts that are reachable publicly and
they will automatically get the Let\(aqs Encrypt certificates when possible, or
can easily use external certificates grabbed from some other CA.
.sp
Some DebOps roles like debops.nginx can check the list of available
PKI realms via the local facts and use some other PKI realm rather than the
default one automatically. For example, if an user creates an "example.com" PKI
realm and then uses the "example.com" DNS domain, standalone or with a
subdomain like "sub.example.com", the debops.nginx role will check if a
PKI realm named after a given FQDN or DNS domain exists and will use it instead
of the "domain" PKI realm used by default. It can be thought of as a shortcut
to easily manage X.509 certificates for multiple websites, each one with its
own FQDN domain name.
.IP \(bu 2
the mail\-based name, like "\fI\%user@example.org\fP <\fBuser@example.org\fP>" \- any PKI realm name which
contains the \(aq@\(aq character qualifies as one. These PKI realms were meant to
keep the client certificates used to authenticate to services, but this idea
was not developed further, so far.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the \fBsubject\fP parameter is not specified, \fBname\fP parameter is checked
to see if it might be a DNS domain (at least 1 dot present in the value). If
yes, it will be used as a default domain for a given PKI realm.

certificate requests to instead of the default one configured in
\fBpki_default_authority\fP variable. This should be the "normal" name of the
authority, not its subdomain name.
.TP
.B \fBacme\fP
Optional, boolean. Enable or disable support for ACME Certificate Authority.
Can be used to invert the global \fBpki_acme\fP setting per PKI realm if
needed, but support for ACME needs to be present on the remote host for it to
work (see \fBpki_acme_install\fP variable).
.TP
.B \fBacme_ca\fP
Optional, name of the ACME API endpoint used by the ACME client. Defaults to
\fBpki_acme_ca\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBacme_ca_api\fP
Optional, the URL of the ACME API endpoint. Defaults to the value in
\fBpki_acme_ca_api_map\fP (whose key defaults to \fBitem.acme_ca\fP).
.TP
.B \fBacme_challenge_dir\fP
Optional, directory where the ACME client should store responses to ACME CA
challenges. Defaults to \fBpki_acme_challenge_dir\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBacme_contacts\fP
Optional, list of (mailto:) URLs that the ACME server can use to contact you
for issues related to your account. For example, the server may wish to
notify you about server\-initiated revocation or certificate expiration. If
not specified, the list defined in \fBpki_acme_contacts\fP will be used.
.TP
.B \fBinternal\fP
Optional, boolean. Enable or disable support for internal CA certificates in
a given realm. If you disable internal CA support, an alternative,
self\-signed certificate will be created and enabled automatically.
.TP
.B \fBauthority_preference\fP
Optional. List of directory names (\fBexternal\fP, \fBacme\fP, \fBinternal\fP,
\fBselfsigned\fP) which determines the order in which the PKI realm looks for
valid certificates. The first found valid certificate is enabled. If not
specified, the order configured in \fBpki_authority_preference\fP will be used.
.TP
.B \fBlibrary\fP
Optional. Specify name of the crypto library used to generate private key and
internal certificate requests in a given PKI realm. Either \fBgnutls\fP
(default) or \fBopenssl\fP\&.

.TP
.B \fBprivate_file_group\fP
Optional. System group which will be set as the group of the private keys
inside of the \fBprivate/\fP directory. It needs to exist, and can be created
using \fBpki_private_groups_present\fP list.
.TP
.B \fBprivate_dir_acl_groups\fP
Optional. List of groups which should be allowed execute (\fBX\fP) permission to
the \fBprivate/\fP realm directory. The access will be granted using filesystem
ACL table. If not specified, the list defined in
\fBpki_private_dir_acl_groups\fP will be applied.
.TP
.B \fBprivate_file_acl_groups\fP
Optional. List of groups which should be allowed read (\fBr\fP) permission to
the files in the \fBprivate/\fP realm directory. The access will be granted
using filesystem ACL table. If not specified, the list defined in
\fBpki_private_file_acl_groups\fP will be applied.
.TP
.B \fBrealm_key_size\fP
Optional. The size of the private key that is to be generated. Defaults to
\fBpki_realm_key_size\fP\&.
.TP

parameters at the end of the certificate chain.
.TP
.B \fBdhparam_file\fP

Optional. Number of days a selfsigned certificate will be valid for.
The default is \fB365\fP days.
.TP
.B \fBenabled\fP, \fBwhen\fP
Optional, boolean. Enable or disable management of a given realm. If
disabled, Ansible will not execute commands related to that realm. The
\fBwhen\fP parameter is meant for automated processing, and \fBenabled\fP should
be used as an user option, exposed through the inventory.

These parameters are related to internal certificates and ACME certificates,
respectively:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBdefault_domain\fP
Optional. Change the default domain used by a given PKI realm. If not
specified, the default domain is based on the \fBname\fP parameter if it has at
least 1 dot, or it will be taken from \fBpki_default_domain\fP variable
which is populated by the \fBansible_domain\fP variable.
.TP
.B \fBdefault_subdomains\fP, \fBacme_default_subdomains\fP
Optional. List of subdomains added to each domain configured in a given PKI
realm. A special value \fB_wildcard_\fP can be used to indicate that a wildcard
domain should be present in the certificate.
.sp
If not specified, \fBpki_default_subdomains\fP (for internal CA) and
