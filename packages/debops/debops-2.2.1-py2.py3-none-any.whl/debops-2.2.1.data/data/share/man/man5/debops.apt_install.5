.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBdebops.apt_install\fP Ansible role is meant to be used as an easy way to
install APT packages on hosts that don\(aqt require more extensive configuration
which would require a more extensive, custom Ansible role. The role itself
exposes several Ansible default variables which can be used to specify custom
lists of packages on different levels of Ansible inventory (global, per\-group
or per\-host).
.SH GETTING STARTED
.SS Initial configuration
.sp
The role comes with a small set of APT packages, useful on pretty much any
Debian or Ubuntu host. Some of the packages are installed conditionally,
depending on different Ansible facts \- for example, firmware packages are
installed on rack servers, which may contain network cards that require custom
firmware loaded by the kernel for proper operation.
.sp
The role is not meant to be used as a dependency of other roles, but you can use it
like that if you want to take advantage of the custom lookup template that uses
conditional package installation depending on installed operating system, its
release or available archive areas.
.sp
The difference between debops.apt and \fBdebops.apt_install\fP Ansible roles
is that the former role is used to configure the APT package manager itself,
and latter just installs packages using APT package manager, depending on its
configuration.
.SS Similar Ansible roles
.sp
There are more comprehensive Ansible roles that install packages:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%ypid.packages\fP <\fBhttps://github.com/ypid/ansible-packages\fP> \- provides
an advanced framework meant to allow installation of packages according to
different host classes, with a large selection of packages. The role is focused
on workstations, live systems and server environments.
.UNINDENT
.SS Example inventory
.sp
The \fBdebops.apt_install\fP role is included by default in the \fBcommon.yml\fP
DebOps playbook. You don\(aqt need to configure anything in the inventory to
enable it.
.sp
The role provides a set of default variables to specify what packages should be
installed on hosts, depending on the inventory level:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBapt_install__packages\fP
This variable should be used in
\fBansible/inventory/group_vars/all/apt_install.yml\fP file and is meant to
specify packages present on all hosts in the inventory.
.TP
.B \fBapt_install__group_packages\fP
This variable should be used in
\fBansible/inventory/group_vars/<group\-name>/apt_install.yml\fP files and is
meant to contain packages that should be installed on hosts in different
Ansible groups. Only one level of this variable is supported, so you should
be careful about your inventory design. Or, you can use it as a master list
that contains different per\-group variables.
.TP
.B \fBapt_install__host_packages\fP
This variable should be used in
\fBansible/inventory/host_vars/<hostname>/apt_install.yml\fP files and is meant
to contain list of packages that should be installed on specific hosts.
.UNINDENT
.SS Example playbook
.sp
\fBdebops.apt_install\fP is designed to be used from a playbook or a role as role
dependency. Here\(aqs an example configuration:

.SH DEFAULT VARIABLE DETAILS
.sp
Some of \fBdebops.apt_install\fP default variables have more extensive
configuration than simple strings or lists, here you can find documentation and
examples for them.
.SS apt_install__debconf
.sp
These YAML lists can be used to add some values to Debconf database. Each entry
has the same keys as the ones used by \fI\%Ansible debconf module\fP <\fBhttps://docs.ansible.com/ansible/debconf_module.html\fP>\&. See its
documentation for parameter advanced usage and syntax.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBname\fP
Required. Name of the package to configure.
.TP
.B \fBquestion\fP
A debconf configuration setting.
.TP
.B \fBunseen\fP
Do not set \(aqseen\(aq flag when pre\-seeding.
.TP
.B \fBvalue\fP
Value to set the configuration to.
.TP
.B \fBvtype\fP
The type of the value supplied.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS apt_install__all_packages
.sp
This variable holds all YAML lists used by the corresponding Ansible lookup
template passed to the \fBapt\fP module. Each element of this list can specify
a name of the APT package to install, or a list of packages, or a YAML
dictionary which defines conditions for the installation of the package(s).
.sp
The different dictionary keys that can be used to specify conditional
installation:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBname\fP
Required. Name of the APT package, or YAML list of package names to install.
.TP
.B \fBstate\fP
Optional. Specify if the given package(s) should be included in the list of
packages to install (not the status of installation). If not specified or
\fBpresent\fP, package(s) will be included, if \fBabsent\fP, packages won\(aqt be
included.
.TP
.B \fBdistribution\fP
Optional. Name or list of operating system distributions. If specified,
a given package or list of packages will be installed only on these
distributions.
.TP
.B \fBrelease\fP
Optional. Name or list of distribution release names. If specified, a given
package or list of packages will be installed only on systems with given OS
releases.
.TP
.B \fBarea\fP
Optional. Name or list of package archive areas (\fBmain\fP, \fBnon\-free\fP,
\fBrestricted\fP, etc.). If specified, role will check if a given archive area
is enabled using Ansible local facts. The specified package(s) will be
installed only when a given area is available. This can be used to avoid
errors with missing packages on systems where non\-free archive areas are not
enabled.
.TP
.B \fBwhitelist\fP
Optional. This variable should reference a list of package names. The lookup
template that filters the list of packages for installation will compare the
names of selected packages against this list, and only packages which are
included will be installed. This is used to provide an alternative, easier
way to select packages for installation without the need to modify a huge,
conditional list.

.SS apt_install__alternatives
.sp
These YAML lists can be used to configure special symlinks (for example,
\fBeditor\fP, \fBx\-terminal\-emulator\fP, \fBpager\fP) which can point to different
applications that provide similar functionality using the
\fBupdate\-alternatives\fP command. Each list element is a YAML dictionary with
specific parameters:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBname\fP
Required. Name of the symlink which should be configured.
.TP
.B \fBpath\fP
Optional. Absolute path to the application which should be symlinked. To see
available alternatives, you can run the command:

If the \fBpath\fP parameter is not specified, the role will configure a given
symlink to select an application automatically.
.TP
.B \fBlink\fP

needed.
.TP
.B \fBpriority\fP
Optional. Set a priority for a given application package. This is rarely
needed.
