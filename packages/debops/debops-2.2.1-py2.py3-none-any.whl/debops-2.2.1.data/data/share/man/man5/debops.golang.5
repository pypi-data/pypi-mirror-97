.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBdebops service/golang\fP [\fB\-\-limit\fP \fIgroup,host,\fP\&...] [\fB\-\-diff\fP] [\fB\-\-check\fP] [\fB\-\-tags\fP \fItag1,tag2,\fP\&...] [\fB\-\-skip\-tags\fP \fItag1,tag2,\fP\&...] [<\fBansible\-playbook\fP options>] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fI\%Go\fP <\fBhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)\fP> is a compiled programming language similar to \fI\%C\fP <\fBhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)\fP>\&. Applications
written in Go are compiled to static binaries, with an aim to simplify
deployment. Many popular data center applications and tools are written in Go.
.sp
The \fBdebops.golang\fP role was designed to support multiple ways of deploying
Go applications using Ansible:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
installation from an APT package, when available;
.IP \(bu 2
installation from source by cloning the application repositories and building
the binaries in situ;
.IP \(bu 2
installation of a precompiled binary downloaded from a remote source;
.UNINDENT
.sp
Installation via APT packages is a preferred method, since this saves compile
time and does not require access to third\-party services. The other
installation methods can be used when a given Go application is not available
in a given OS release, or the upstream does not provide APT repositories.
.sp
The \fBdebops.golang\fP role should be used as a dependent Ansible role in other
role playbooks, to simplify installation of the Go applications. Further
service configuration should be done in a given application role. Usage via the
Ansible inventory is, of course, still possible but might not be optimal.
.SH GETTING STARTED
.SS Ansible local facts
.sp
The debops.golang role provides a set of Ansible local facts at the
\fBansible_local.golang.*\fP namespace. The facts can be used to determine the
location of the Go application binaries \- installation from APT package or from
source can result in different binary location (\fB/usr/bin/\fP vs
\fB/usr/local/bin/\fP) which might require different path specification in
\fBsystemd\fP unit files, for example.
.SS Example inventory
.sp
To configure a Go environment on a given host or set of hosts, they need to
be added to \fB[debops_service_golang]\fP Ansible group in the inventory:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[debops_service_golang]
hostname
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The role will install Go development environment by default if no other Go
packages are defined via \fBgolang__dependent_packages\fP variable, by
other Ansible roles.
.SS Example playbook
.sp
If you are using this role without DebOps, or you want to use it as
a dependency for another Ansible role, here\(aqs an example Ansible playbook that
uses the \fBdebops.golang\fP role:
.INDENT 0.0

.SH USAGE EXAMPLES
.sp
These example configurations show how debops.golang role can be used
either via the Ansible inventory, or by other Ansible roles using role
dependent variables.
.SS The \fBdocker\-gen\fP package
.sp
The \fI\%docker\-gen\fP <\fBhttps://github.com/jwilder/docker-gen\fP> application can be used to generate configuration files or
scripts based on templates with \fI\%Docker\fP <\fBhttps://docker.com/\fP> metadata as a configuration source.
The debops.docker_gen role can be used to install and configure it as
a system service.
.sp
To build the \fBdocker\-gen\fP Go binary, \fBgocolorize\fP and \fBglock\fP Go
packages are required as build dependencies (they don\(aqt need to be installed
system\-wide, only in the build environment). The \fBgocolorize\fP Go package is
packaged in Debian, but \fBglock\fP is not. All three source repositories do not
provide GPG\-signed tags or commits, \fBglock\fP does not even have a tagged
release (old software tends to be like that).
.sp
This is an example install configuration for the debops.golang role:

.sp
The debops.golang role will install the \fBgocolorize\fP dev package from
Debian if it\(aqs available, otherwise it will be built and installed in the Go
build environment from its source repository.
.sp
The \fBglock\fP Go package is not included in Debian, therefore it will be built
and installed from its source repository. Note that the repository does not
have a release, therefore the \fBmaster\fP branch is checked out by default; an
additional \fBgo\-buildutil\fP Go package is also installed using the \fBgo
get\fP command. \fBglock\fP is only a build dependency, and is not installed
system\-wide.
.sp
The \fBdocker\-gen\fP Go package is cloned from its source repository on
a specific \fBgit\fP tag. Additional APT packages required for building
the binary are installed from the Debian repository. The built binary is
installed to \fB/usr/local/bin/\fP directory and registered in the Go package
database maintained by the role.
.SS The \fBetcd\fP package
.sp
The \fI\%etcd\fP <\fBhttps://etcd.io/\fP> application is a distributed key\-value store written in Go, with
a server and client binaries. \fBetcd\fP is included in Debian Buster, but
can also be installed from upstream.

The debops.golang Ansible role will check if the specified APT packages
are available; if not, the specified version will be cloned from the sources
repository and the \fBgit\fP tag will be verified using the specified GPG
key. When the build is finished, the pecified binaries will be installed in the
\fB/usr/local/bin/\fP directory.
.SS The \fBnomad\fP package
.sp
\fI\%Hashicorp Nomad\fP <\fBhttps://www.nomadproject.io/\fP> is a job orchestrator which, combined with Consul and Vault
services, can be used to manage containerized and non\-containerized
applications in a cluster.
.sp
Nomad is currently (as of 2019) not packaged in Debian Stable. Hashicorp
provides its own download server for their applications, we can use that to
download the Nomad binary directly.

on the host, download the specified tarball from the Hashicorp release server,
extract its contents and copy the specified \fBnomad\fP binary to the
\fB/usr/local/bin/\fP directory.
.SS The \fBminio\fP package
.sp
\fI\%MinIO\fP <\fBhttps://minio.io/\fP> is an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) compatible object storage
server written in Go. It\(aqs currently not included in Debian, but upstream
provides GPG\-signed binary releases regularly, and it\(aqs also possible to build

Because there\(aqs no \fBapt_packages\fP parameter, the role will install the
upstream version by default. The \fBupstream_type\fP parameter is sed to \fBurl\fP,
which means that debops.golang will download the specified binary and
its \fB\&.asc\fP GPG signature, verify the GPG signature against the GPG key
installed by the role and install the specified binary in the
\fB/usr/local/bin/\fP directory.
.sp
Alternatively, the user can request installation using the \fBgit\fP
sources, which can be done by adding in the inventory:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.nf
.ft C
golang__packages:

  \- name: \(aqminio\(aq
    state: \(aqappend\(aq
    upstream_type: \(aqgit\(aq
.ft P

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will tell the debops.golang role to download the \fBminio\fP
source code and compile it locally. The compiled binary will be installed in
the \fB/usr/local/bin/\fP directory.
.sp
In both cases, if the \fBminio\fP binary is changed, the \fB"Restart
minio"\fP Ansible handler will be notified. This is useful in cases where Go
packages are installed for other Ansible roles via role dependent variables,
where the handler can be defined in the application role. Usage of the
\fBhandler\fP parameter should be avoided in Go packages defined via the Ansible
inventory.
.SH DEFAULT VARIABLE DETAILS
.sp
Some of \fBdebops.golang\fP default variables have more extensive configuration than
simple strings or lists, here you can find documentation and examples for them.
.SS golang__packages
.sp
Each \fBgolang__*_packages\fP variable contains a list of YAML dictionaries, each
dictionary defines a Go package installation using specific parameters:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBname\fP
Required. A name of the Go package definition. Multiple configuration entries
with the same \fBname\fP parameter are merged together in order of appearance.
This parameter is not used for anything else.
.TP
.B \fBstate\fP
Optional. If not defined or \fBpresent\fP, the Go application will be
installed. When the parameter is set to \fBabsent\fP or \fBignore\fP, the Go
application will not be processed by Ansible; there\(aqs currently no support
for uninstalling already installed Go applications.
.sp
If the parameter is set to \fBappend\fP, a given configuration entry will be
evaluated only if the entry with the same \fBname\fP was already defined
earlier. This can be useful to modify role dependent configuration through
the Ansible inventory.
.TP
.B \fBapt_packages\fP
Optional. A string or a list of APT packages with the Go application to
install. If the APT packages are not available, the role will automatically
switch to an installation from upstream.
.TP
.B \fBapt_required_packages\fP
Optional. List of APT packages which should be present on a host when Go
application is downloaded directly from upstream. Some of the Go applications
are distributed as tarballs; installing \fBunzip\fP APT packages might be
requires to uncompress the \fB\&.zip\fP archives.
.TP
.B \fBapt_dev_packages\fP
Optional. List of APT packages which should be present on a host when Go
application is built from source. You can specify here additional packages
that are required for building the binary; the
\fBgolang__apt_dev_packages\fP variable contains the default set of APT
packages which will be installed when a Go application is to be built from
source.
.TP
.B \fBupstream\fP
Optional, boolean. If defined and \fBTrue\fP, install the Go application from
upstream, even if APT packages are available. The \fBFalse\fP value will result
in not installing the Go application at all if the APT packages are not
available.
.TP
.B \fBupstream_type\fP
Optional. Specify the type of upstream installation to perform, either
\fBgit\fP (default) to install the Go application from source, or \fBurl\fP to
download the Go application binaries directly. Either option needs to be
configured as well for the preferred installation method to work.
.TP
.B \fBgpg\fP
Optional. A string or a list of GPG key fingerprints to add to the
\fBgolang__user\fP GPG keyring. The key management is performed by the
debops.keyring Ansible role; you can use the
keyring__ref_dependent_gpg_keys syntax to define the GPG keys to
install or remove.
.TP
.B \fBurl\fP
Optional. A list of YAML dictionaries, each dictionary defines a remote
resource which can be downloaded to the UNIX account defined in the
\fBgolang__user\fP variable, optionally unpacked from an archive by the
\fBunarchive\fP Ansible module and verified using GPG keys. With this
parameter, Go applications can be downloaded directly from upstream.
.sp
Each entry in the list is defined with specific parameters:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBsrc\fP
Required. The URL of the file to download.
.TP
.B \fBdest\fP
Required. Directory where the downloaded file will be stored, relative to
the \fBgolang__gosrc\fP directory.
.TP
.B \fBchecksum\fP
Optional. Checksum (usually \fBsha256\fP) of the downloaded file. This
parameter is not strictly required, but should be used with bigger files
because without the checksum available Ansible will download the specified
file on each run to compare it with the downloaded file.
.TP
.B \fBunarchive\fP
Optional, boolean. If defined and \fBTrue\fP, a given file is presumed to be
a tarball and its contents will be extracted with the \fBunarchive\fP Ansible
module.
.TP
.B \fBunarchive_dest\fP
Optional. Path where the contents of the specified file will be unarchived
to, relative to the \fBgolang__gosrc\fP directory. If not specified,
files will be extracted in the same directory where the archive was
downloaded to.
.TP
.B \fBunarchive_creates\fP
Optional. Specify a path relative to the \fBgolang__gosrc\fP directory.
If that path is present on the host, the \fBunarchive\fP Ansible module will
not try to extract the archive contents again on the next Ansible run,
ensuring idempotency.
.TP
.B \fBgpg_verify\fP
Optional, boolean. If defined and \fBTrue\fP, the role will use the
\fBgpg \-\-verify\fP command to check the valid signature of a file.
.sp
it\(aqs best to first download the intended file, and then its detached GPG
signature (usually with the \fB\&.asc\fP extension) which should have this
parameter enabled; the \fBgpg\fP command will automatically assume
that the signed file is named after the signature file, without the
\fB\&.asc\fP extension. The GPG keys need to be defined using the \fBgpg\fP
parameter to be correctly imported beforehand by the debops.keyring
role.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBurl_binaries\fP
Optional. List of downloaded binaries which should be installed system\-wide,
by default in the \fB/usr/local/bin/\fP directory.
.sp
Each list entry can define a path to the binary, relative to the
\fBgolang__gosrc\fP path. The specified binary will be copied to the
default installation directory without renaming the binary.
.sp
Alternatively, a given binary can be described using a YAML dictionary with
specific parameters:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBsrc\fP
Path to a given binary, relative to the \fBgolang__gosrc\fP directory.
.TP
.B \fBdest\fP
Path where a given binary should be installed. You can specify just the
name of the binary, in which case it will be installed in
\fB/usr/local/bin/\fP directory by default.
.TP
.B \fBmode\fP
Specify the default file mode to use. If not specified, \fB0755\fP will be
used by default.
.TP
.B \fBnotify\fP
A string or a YAML list of Ansible handlers to notify when a binary is
first installed or updated. This parameter only makes sense when the
debops.golang role is ued in a playbook as a dependent role, and the
subsequent application role(s) define a handler to use. In such case, this
functionality can be used to restart a service after the binary is
upgraded.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBgit\fP
Optional. List of YAML dictionaries, each dictionary defines a \fBgit\fP
repository which can be cloned to the UNIX account defined in the
\fBgolang__user\fP variable and subsequently can be used to build the Go
application binaries from source. The \fBgit\fP tag or commit signatures
will be verified if the GPG keys are configured using the \fBgpg\fP parameter.
.sp
Each \fBgit\fP repository is defined using specific parameters:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBrepo\fP
The URL of the \fBgit\fP repository to clone. Currently only
\fBhttps://\fP scheme is supported.
.TP
.B \fBdest\fP
The path to which the specified repository will be cloned, relative to the
\fBgolang__gosrc\fP directory. If not specified, the \fBdest\fP directory
will be based on the URL specified in the \fBrepo\fP parameter.
.TP
.B \fBversion\fP / \fBbranch\fP
The \fBgit\fP branch or tag to check out after cloning the repository.
.TP
.B \fBdepth\fP
If specified, only the specified number of revisions will be cloned instead
of the whole repository. If not specified, the value of the
\fBgolang__git_depth\fP variable will be used by default.
.TP
.B \fBbuild_script\fP
A string or YAML text block with a shell script that specifies how the Go
application should be built. It will be executed as a Bash script, with the
\fBgolang__user\fP privileges, in the directory where the repository
has been cloned.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBgit_binaries\fP
Optional. List of built binaries which should be installed system\-wide, by
default in the \fB/usr/local/bin/\fP directory.
.sp
Each list entry can define a path to the binary, relative to the
\fBgolang__gosrc\fP path. The specified binary will be copied to the
default installation directory without renaming the binary.
.sp
Alternatively, a given binary can be described using a YAML dictionary with
specific parameters:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBsrc\fP
Path to a given binary, relative to the \fBgolang__gosrc\fP directory.
.TP
.B \fBdest\fP
Path where a given binary should be installed. You can specify just the
name of the binary, in which case it will be installed in
\fB/usr/local/bin/\fP directory by default.
.TP
.B \fBmode\fP
Specify the default file mode to use. If not specified, \fB0755\fP will be
used by default.
.TP
.B \fBnotify\fP
A string or a YAML list of Ansible handlers to notify when a binary is
first installed or updated. This parameter only makes sense when the
debops.golang role is ued in a playbook as a dependent role, and the
subsequent application role(s) define a handler to use. In such case, this
functionality can be used to restart a service after the binary is
upgraded.
