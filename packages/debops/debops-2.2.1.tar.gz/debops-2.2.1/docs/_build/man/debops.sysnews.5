.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBdebops service/sysnews\fP [\fB\-\-limit\fP \fIgroup,host,\fP\&...] [\fB\-\-diff\fP] [\fB\-\-check\fP] [\fB\-\-tags\fP \fItag1,tag2,\fP\&...] [\fB\-\-skip\-tags\fP \fItag1,tag2,\fP\&...] [<\fBansible\-playbook\fP options>] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This role can be used to manage "System News" bulletin displayed after users
log in to a particular host using local system console or SSH. System News can
be used to notify users about important changes on the host; this is especially
useful in multi\-user environments or on bastion hosts.
.sp
The System News can be read by executing the \fBnews\fP command in the
shell. You can read all of the news entries by executing the \fBnews \-a\fP
command.
.SH GETTING STARTED
.SS How to add news manually
.sp
The System News entries added by this role using \fBsysnews__*_entries\fP
variables are permanent, ie. they will not expire automatically after a month.
.sp
System administrators can add more temporary news entries by putting text files
in the \fB/var/lib/sysnews/\fP directory, with the filename being the title
of a news item. This directory is owned by the \fBstaff\fP UNIX system group, and
any users in this group can also add entries in that directory. Custom news
entries will be automatically removed after a month.
.sp
To make temporary news items permanent, you can edit the
\fB/var/lib/sysnews/.noexpire\fP file. Put names of the custom files to
retain outside of the \fBANSIBLE MANAGED BLOCK\fP section, this way your custom
changes will be preserved during the next Ansible run of this role.
.SS Example inventory
.sp
The \fBdebops.sysnews\fP role can be enabled on a host when it\(aqs added to
a particular Ansible inventory group:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[debops_service_sysnews]
hostname
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT

.SS Example playbook
.sp
If you are using this role without DebOps, here\(aqs an example Ansible playbook
that uses the \fBdebops.sysnews\fP role:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-\-\-

.SH DEFAULT VARIABLE DETAILS
.sp
Some of the \fBdebops.sysnews\fP default variables have more extensive
configuration than simple strings or lists, here you can find documentation and
examples for them.
.SS sysnews__entries
.sp
The \fBsysnews__*_entries\fP lists can be used to add or manage permanent
System News entries in the \fB/var/lib/sysnews/\fP directory. The variables
are combined in the order specified by the \fBsysnews__combined_entries\fP
variable, entries with the same name are combined together; the entries later
in the list override parameters from previous entry with the same name.
.sp
Each list entry is a YAML dictionary with specific parameters:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBname\fP
Required. Name of the text file located in the \fB/var/lib/sysnews/\fP
directory (spaces if the filename are permitted).
.TP
.B \fBsrc\fP
Optional, conflicts with \fBcontent\fP\&. Path to a text file located on the
Ansible Controller, which should be put in the \fB/var/lib/sysnews/\fP
directory with a given name. By default the path is relative to the
\fBfiles/\fP directory of the \fBdebops.sysnews\fP Ansible role.
.TP
.B \fBcontent\fP
Optional, conflicts with \fBsrc\fP\&. YAML text block which contains a text to
put in a file in the \fB/var/lib/sysnews/\fP directory with a given name.
The text can contain Jinja templating which will be evaluated at Ansible
execution time.
.TP
.B \fBstate\fP
Optional. Define the state of a particular news file. If multiple list
entries define a file state, the last one wins. Recognized states:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
not specified or \fBpresent\fP: the file will be put in the
\fB/var/lib/sysnews/\fP directory.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBabsent\fP: the specified file will be removed.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBignore\fP: the given configuration entry will be ignored by the role. This
can be used to conditionally activate or skip entries.
