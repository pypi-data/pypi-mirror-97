.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBdebops service/users\fP [\fB\-\-limit\fP \fIgroup,host,\fP\&...] [\fB\-\-diff\fP] [\fB\-\-check\fP] [\fB\-\-tags\fP \fItag1,tag2,\fP\&...] [\fB\-\-skip\-tags\fP \fItag1,tag2,\fP\&...] [<\fBansible\-playbook\fP options>] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBdebops.users\fP Ansible role can be used to manage local user accounts and
groups. The role allows for certain operations inside of the home directories,
like configuration of the mail forwarding, SSH public keys or automatic
deployment of user configuration files (dotfiles).
.sp
This role is designed to manage regular user accounts and application accounts.
In a LDAP\-enabled environment, it might be better to configure these using LDAP
directory, and manage local system administrator accounts using the
debops.system_users Ansible role.
.SH GETTING STARTED
.SS Support for \fBlibuser\fP library
.sp
The role uses the \fBlibuser\fP library, supported by the \fBgroup\fP and \fBuser\fP
Ansible modules, to manage the UNIX groups and accounts present on the hosts.
The library is used to ensure that the groups and accounts created locally on
the host that uses the LDAP directory as the user/group database have UID/GID
values in the correct ranges, thus avoiding collisions with the LDAP directory
UID/GID ranges. Without the \fBlibuser\fP these local groups and accounts would
be created in the LDAP UID/GID ranges, since the normal UNIX user management
tools pick the next UID/GID based on the contents of the \fBgetent\fP output, and
not from the local user and group databases.
.sp
This behaviour can be controlled using the \fBitem.local\fP parameter, which by
default is enabled and shouldn\(aqt be specified directly unless you want to
override the use of the \fBlibuser\fP library for some reason. Due to issues with
the Ansible modules, additional UNIX groups are managed using normal UNIX tools
instead of their \fBlibuser\fP equivalents.
.SS Example inventory
.sp
The \fBdebops.users\fP Ansible role is included by default in the
\fBcommon.yml\fP DebOps playbook; you don\(aqt need to do anything to have it
executed.
.sp
If you donâ€™t want to let \fBdebops.users\fP manage user accounts, you can disable
it with the following setting in your inventory:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.SS Ansible tags
.sp
You can use Ansible \fB\-\-tags\fP or \fB\-\-skip\-tags\fP parameters to limit what
tasks are performed during Ansible run. This can be used after host is first
configured to speed up playbook execution, when you are sure that most of the
configuration has not been changed.
.sp
Common role tags:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBrole::users\fP
Main role tag, should be used in the playbook to execute all of the role
tasks as well as role dependencies.
.TP
.B \fBskip::users\fP
Main role tag, should be used in the playbook to skip all of the role tasks.
.TP
.B \fBskip::check\fP
Used in specific tasks that might break in the Ansible \fB\-\-check\fP mode on
first run of the role on a host, but not subsequent runs. It can be used to
skip these tasks in such case.

.SH DEFAULT VARIABLE DETAILS
.sp
Some of \fBdebops.users\fP default variables have more extensive configuration than
simple strings or lists, here you can find documentation and examples for them.
.SS users__accounts
.sp
The \fBusers__*_groups\fP and \fBusers__*_accounts\fP variables define the UNIX
group and UNIX user accounts which should be managed by Ansible. The
distinctive names can be used to order the UNIX group creation before the
account creation; otherwise both variable sets use the same content.

.SS Syntax
.sp
The variables are lists of YAML dictionaries, each dictionary defines an UNIX
group or an UNIX account using specific parameters.
.SS General account parameters
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBname\fP
Required. Name of the UNIX user account to manage. If \fBgroup\fP parameter is
not specified, this value is also used to create a private UNIX group for
a given user. Configuration entries with the same \fBname\fP parameter are
merged in order of appearance, this can be used to modify existing
configuration entries conditionally.
.TP
.B \fBuser\fP
Optional, boolean. If not specified or \fBTrue\fP, a configuration entry will
manage both an UNIX account and its primary UNIX group. If \fBFalse\fP, only
the UNIX group is managed; this can be used to define shared system groups.
You can also use the debops.system_groups Ansible role to define UNIX
groups with additional functionality like \fBsudo\fP configuration, etc.
.TP
.B \fBlocal\fP
Optional, boolean. If not specified or \fBTrue\fP, the role will use the
\fBlibuser\fP library to manage the UNIX groups and accounts in the local
account and group database. If \fBFalse\fP, the role will use standard UNIX
tools to manage accounts, which might have unintended effects. On normal
operation you shouldn\(aqt need to define this parameter, it\(aqs enabled or
disabled by the role as needed.
.sp
See users__ref_libuser for more details.
.TP
.B \fBsystem\fP
Optional, boolean. If \fBTrue\fP, a given user account and primary group will
be a "system" account and group, with it\(aqs UID and GID < 1000. If the value
is not specified or \fBFalse\fP, the user account and group will be a "normal"
account and group with UID and GID >= 1000.
.TP
.B \fBchroot\fP
Optional, boolean. If defined and \fBTrue\fP, a given user account is
configured to support SFTPonly operation, and certain defaults are changed if
not overridden by other parameters.
.sp
The owner of the home directory will be the \fBroot\fP account instead of the
user, to allow chrooting to that directory, the home directory group will be
the primary group of a given user. The default permissions are set to
\fB0751\fP\&.
.sp
The default shell is set based on the \fBusers__chroot_shell\fP variable,
by default it will be \fB/usr/sbin/nologin\fP\&. Any dotfiles configured
globally or for that UNIX account are not installed due to permission issues
in the home directory.
.sp
The account will be added to UNIX groups specified in the
\fBusers__chroot_groups\fP variable, by default \fBsftponly\fP\&. See the
debops.sshd role for details about configuring the SFTPonly access in
OpenSSH server.
.TP
.B \fBuid\fP
Optional. Specify the UID of the UNIX user account.
.TP
.B \fBgid\fP
Optional. Specify the GID of the primary group for a given user account.
.TP
.B \fBgroup\fP
Optional. Name of the UNIX group which will be set as the primary group of
a given account. If \fBgroup\fP is not specified, \fBname\fP will be used
automatically to create the corresponding UNIX group.
.TP
.B \fBprivate_group\fP
Optional, boolean. If specified and \fBFalse\fP, the role will not try to
directly manage the specified UNIX \fBgroup\fP used with a given UNIX account.
This is useful if you want to set a primary UNIX group that\(aqs used in other
places and which you might not want to remove with the UNIX account.
.TP
.B \fBgroups\fP
Optional. List of UNIX groups to which a given UNIX account should belong.
Only existing groups will be added to the account.
.TP
.B \fBappend\fP
Optional, boolean. If \fBTrue\fP (default), the specified groups will be added
to the list of existing groups the account belongs to. If \fBFalse\fP, all
other groups than those present on the group list will be removed stripped.
.TP
.B \fBcomment\fP
Optional. A comment, or GECOS field configured for a specified UNIX account.
.TP
.B \fBshell\fP
Optional. Specify the default shell to run when a given UNIX account logs in.
If not specified, the default system shell (usually \fB/bin/sh\fP will be
used instead).
.TP
.B \fBpassword\fP
Optional. Specify the encrypted hash of the user\(aqs password which will be set
for a given UNIX account. You can use the \fBlookup("password")\fP lookup to
generate the hash. See examples for more details.
.TP
.B \fBupdate_password\fP
Optional. If set to \fBon_create\fP, the password will be set only one on
initial user creation. If set to \fBalways\fP, the password will be updated on
each Ansible run if it\(aqs different.
.sp
The module default is to always update the password, the \fBdebops.users\fP
default is to only update the password on initial user creation.
.TP
.B \fBno_log\fP
Optional, boolean. If defined and \fBTrue\fP, a given entry will not be logged
during the Ansible run. If not specified, if the \fBpassword\fP parameter is
specified, the role will automatically disable logging as well.
.TP
.B \fBnon_unique\fP
Optional, boolean. If \fBTrue\fP, allows setting the UID to a non\-unique value.
.TP
.B \fBlinger\fP
Optional, boolean. If \fBTrue\fP, the UNIX account will be allowed to linger
when not logged in and manage private services via it\(aqs own
\fBsystemd\fP user instance. If \fBFalse\fP, the linger option will be
disabled.
.UNINDENT
.SS Parameters related to account state
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBstate\fP
Optional. If \fBpresent\fP, the UNIX user account and primary group will be
created. If \fBabsent\fP, the specified account and group will be removed.
.TP
.B \fBforce\fP
Optional, boolean. If used with \fBstate\fP parameter being \fBabsent\fP, Ansible
will execute the \fBuserdel \-\-force\fP command.
.TP
.B \fBremove\fP
Optional, boolean. If used with \fBstate\fP parameter being \fBabsent\fP, Ansible
will execute the \fBuserdel \-\-remove\fP command.
.TP
.B \fBexpires\fP
Optional. Specify the time in the UNIX epoch format, at which a given UNIX
user account will be disabled.
.UNINDENT
.SS Parameters related to home directories
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBhome\fP
Optional. Path to the home directory of a given user account. If not
specified, the role will check the home directory path of an existing account
defined on the host.
.sp
The debops.users role does not create parent directories of home
directories. If you try to create a home directory in a non\-existent
subdirectory, Ansible will fail. This might be problematic due to the role
order in the playbook.
.sp
You can use the debops.fhs role to ensure that the base directories
exist before creating home directories in them. For example, a common
practice is creation of the web application home directories inside of the
\fB/srv/www/\fP subdirectory which doesn\(aqt exist by default. The
debops.fhs role will create it automatically \- it is included in the
DebOps \fBcommon.yml\fP playbook, and you can include it in custom
playbooks if needed. See the fhs__ref_directories documentation for
more details.
.TP
.B \fBhome_owner\fP
Optional. Specify the owner of the home directory of a given UNIX account.
.TP
.B \fBhome_group\fP
Optional. Specify the group of the home directory of a given UNIX account.
.TP
.B \fBhome_mode\fP
Optional. Specify the mode of the home directory of a given UNIX account. If
not specified, the value of the \fBusers__default_home_mode\fP will be
used instead.
.TP
.B \fBcreate_home\fP
Optional, boolean. If \fBTrue\fP, the role will create the home directory for
a given user account if it doesn\(aqt exist already. If not specified, home
directory is created by default by the \fI\%Ansible user module\fP <\fBhttps://docs.ansible.com/ansible/user_module.html\fP>\&.
.TP
.B \fBmove_home\fP
Optional, boolean. If \fBTrue\fP and the managed user account already exists,
Ansible will try to move it\(aqs home directory to the location specified in the
\fBhome\fP parameter if it isn\(aqt there already.
.TP
.B \fBskeleton\fP
Optional. Specify path to the directory, contents of which will be copied to
the newly created home directory.
.TP
.B \fBhome_acl\fP
Optional. Configure filesystem ACL entries of the home directory of a given
UNIX user account. This parameter is a list of YAML dictionaries, each
element uses a specific set of parameters derived from the \fBacl\fP Ansible
module, see its documentation for details, as well as the \fI\%acl(5)\fP <\fBhttps://manpages.debian.org/acl(5)\fP>,
\fI\%setfacl(1)\fP <\fBhttps://manpages.debian.org/setfacl(1)\fP> and \fI\%getfacl\fP <\fBhttps://manpages.debian.org/getfacl\fP> manual pages. Some useful parameters:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBdefault\fP
Optional, boolean. If \fBTrue\fP, set a given ACL entry as the default for
new files and directories inside a given directory. Only works with
directories.
.TP
.B \fBentity\fP
Name of the UNIX user account or group that a given ACL entry applies to.
.TP
.B \fBetype\fP
Specify the ACL entry type to configure. Valid choices: \fBuser\fP,
\fBgroup\fP, \fBmask\fP, \fBother\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBpermissions\fP
Specify the permission to apply for a given ACL entry. This parameter
cannot be specified when the state of an ACL entry is set to \fBabsent\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBrecursive\fP
Apply a given ACL entry recursively to all entities in a given path.
.TP
.B \fBstate\fP
Optional. If not specified or \fBpresent\fP, the ACL entry will be created.
If \fBabsent\fP, the ACL entry will be removed. The \fBquery\fP state doesn\(aqt
make sense in this context and shouldn\(aqt be used.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Parameters related to the account\(aqs private SSH key
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBgenerate_ssh_key\fP
Optional, boolean. If \fBTrue\fP, Ansible will generate a private SSH key for
the specified account.
.TP
.B \fBssh_key_bits\fP
Optional. Number of bits to use for the user\(aqs private SSH key. If not
specified, role will use the \fI\%Ansible user module\fP <\fBhttps://docs.ansible.com/ansible/user_module.html\fP> default value.
.TP
.B \fBssh_key_comment\fP
Optional. Add a custom comment to the generated SSH key.

Optional. String or a YAML list of public SSH keys to configure for a given
user account. The keys will be stored in the \fB~/.ssh/authorized_keys\fP
file.
.TP
.B \fBsshkeys_exclusive\fP
Optional, boolean. If \fBTrue\fP, the role will remove all keys from the user\(aqs
\fB~/.ssh/authorized_keys\fP file that are not specified in the \fBsshkeys\fP
parameter.
.TP
.B \fBsshkeys_state\fP
Optional. If not specified or \fBpresent\fP, the SSH keys will be set on the
user\(aqs account. If \fBabsent\fP, the \fB~/.ssh/authorized_keys\fP file will be
removed entirely.
.UNINDENT
.SS Parameters related to mail forwarding
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBforward\fP
Optional. String or YAML list of e\-mail addresses which will be used to
forward mail directed to a given UNIX account. They will be stored in the
\fB~/.forward\fP file. This is only valid for MTAs that support this mechanism,
for example Postfix MTA when local mail is enabled.
.TP
.B \fBforward_state\fP
Optional. If not specified or \fBpresent\fP, the e\-mail addresses specified in
the \fBforward\fP parameter will be added to the \fB~/.forward\fP configuration
file. If \fBabsent\fP, the entries will be removed from the configuration file.

Optional, boolean. Enable or disable management of the user configuration
files.
.TP
.B \fBdotfiles_repo\fP
Optional. An URL or an absolute path on the host to the \fBgit\fP

default dotfiles repository, defined in the \fBusers__dotfiles_repo\fP
variable, will be used instead. The repository will be deployed or updated
using the \fByadm\fP script, installed by the debops.yadm Ansible
role.
.UNINDENT
.SS Parameters related to directory and file resources
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBresources\fP
This parameter can be used to manage directories, files and symlinks for
specific UNIX accounts using Ansible inventory. This functionality is meant to
be used to manage small amounts of data, like custom configuration files,
private SSH keys and so on. For more advanced management, you should consider
using debops.resources Ansible role, or even writing a custom Ansible
role from scratch.
.sp
Tasks that manage the resources are executed as the \fBroot\fP account, but the
owner and group of the files is automatically set to those used by a given UNIX
account. Directory and file paths will be prepended with a path to the
\fB$HOME\fP directory of a given user, and should be defined as relative, without
\fB/\fP at the beginning.
.sp
The \fBresources\fP parameter should contain a list of entries, each entry should
be defined as either a path string which denotes a directory relative to the
user\(aqs \fB$HOME\fP directory, or a YAML dictionary that describes a given
resource using specific parameters:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBdest\fP or \fBpath\fP
Required. Path to the resource managed by this entry, relative to the user\(aqs
\fB$HOME\fP directory. All subdirectories specified in the path will be created
automatically.
.TP
.B \fBcontent\fP
If the resource type is a \fBfile\fP, this parameter can be used to specify the
contents of the file that is managed by this entry, usually in the form of
a YAML text block. It shouldn\(aqt be specified together with the \fBsrc\fP
parameter.
.TP
.B \fBsrc\fP
If the resource type is a \fBlink\fP, this parameter specifies the target of
the symlink. In case of symlinks to resources owned by other UNIX accounts
than the user, you need to specify the \fBowner\fP and \fBgroup\fP parameters to
that of the symlinked file (for example \fBroot\fP for files or directories
owned by the \fBroot\fP account), otherwise the role will change them to the
owner/group of a given user.
.sp
If the resource type is a \fBfile\fP, this parameter can be used to specify the
source file on the Ansible Controller to copy to the remote host. It
shouldn\(aqt be specified together with the \fBcontent\fP parameter.
.TP
.B \fBstate\fP
Optional. This variable defines the resource state and it\(aqs type:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBabsent\fP: the resource will be removed
.IP \(bu 2
\fBdirectory\fP: the resource is a directory
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfile\fP: the resource is a file
.IP \(bu 2
\fBlink\fP: the resource is a symlink
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtouch\fP: the resource will create an empty file, or "touch" an existing
file on each Ansible run
.UNINDENT
.sp
If this parameter is not specified, the resource will be treated as
a directory.
.TP
