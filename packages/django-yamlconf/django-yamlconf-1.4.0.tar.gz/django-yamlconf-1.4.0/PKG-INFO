        django-yamlconf
        ===============
        
        ``django_yamlconf`` is part of VMware's support of open source
        development and community.
        
        Handle YAML based Django settings: load Django settings from YAML files
        based on a Django project name. The YAML files loaded start with a YAML
        file in the directory containing the Django settings file and then loads
        any other YAMLCONF files up the directory tree from the initial file.
        Values from files higher up the directory tree over-ride lower in the
        tree. The contents of the YAML file simply defines values that over-ride
        (or add to) attributes of the standard Django settings file, e.g., for
        the project "buildaudit", the settings.py file could contain:
        
        .. code:: python
        
                DEBUG = True
        
        i.e., the value for development. This can be redefined via a
        ``buildaudit.yaml`` file using the definition:
        
        .. code:: python
        
                DEBUG: false
        
        If the environment variable ``YAMLCONF_CONFFILE`` is defined, it uses as
        the final YAML file loaded (in this case, the file name does not need to
        match the project name and it can be located anywhere in the file
        system).
        
        Quick Start
        -----------
        
        The YAMLCONF definitions are added to the Django settings file by
        including a call to the ``load`` function in the settings file. This
        would normally be towards the end of the settings file. The simplest,
        and likely normal usage is to call without arguments. YAMLCONF will
        infer the project information from the call stack. For a standard Django
        application structure, the settings file::
        
                myproject/myproject/settings.py
        
        would contain the development oriented definitions, e.g., database
        definitions for user and password for a development database. The
        settings file would then end with a call the the ``load`` function.
        Additional definitions could be defined after the ``load`` function to
        update conditional definitions, e.g., if ``DEBUG`` is enabled.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import django_yamlconf
        
            ...
        
            DATABASES = {
                'default': {
                    'NAME': 'example',
                    'USER': 'example',
                    'PASSWORD': 'example',
                    'HOST': 'localhost',
                    ...
                }
            }
            ...
        
            django_yamlconf.load()
        
        On a production server, for this example, a ``myproject.yaml`` would be
        put in place containing the host name for the production database and
        the password for the example user (assuming production is using the same
        database name and username). In this example, a random ``pwgen``
        password is used:
        
        .. code:: yaml
        
            DATABASES.default.PASSWORD: 'zibiemohjuD6foh0'
            DATABASES.default.HOST: 'myproject-db.eng.vmware.com'
        
        See the ``load`` function for more information on other optional
        arguments.
