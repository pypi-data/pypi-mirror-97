Notes for me to remember steps involved in publishing this package

- create branch on local machine

- make modifications

- if test_data is not in the root directory, get it with 
  ./download_test_data.sh

   On the science network, can link to dataset with:
   /home/dja001/shared_stuff/files/test_data_for_domutils_on_zenodo/v?.?.?

- run unitttests
  python -m unittest discover

    This should find and run 125 tests

- run doctests and make documentation
  cd docs/
  make clean
  make doctest
  make html


- If the test makes a figure or that new test data is required
  the a new test dataset will have to be published in a new version of the repository on zenodo
  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3635906    
  At the moment, only me (dominik) can do that. Contact me and I will do it for you. 

  Updating the dataset version and file list will be necessary
  download_test_data.sh

  Run the tests with the new test_data directory if it got changed

- adjust version number in VERSION

- adjust version number in 
     conda_build/domutils/meta.yaml  I need to find a way to automate this

- describe changes in CHANGELOG

- make bundle by running:
    - You probably want to cleanup
    python setup.py clean --all
    rm -rf dist

 python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        - upload to TEST pypi
        twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*

- upload to official pypi repo
twine upload dist/*

- from the root of the repo from somewhere with internet connexion
    To load in environment if not already done:
        conda install anaconda-client conda-build
conda build conda_build/domutils

and upload it to anaconda cloud

- can test local build with :
        conda install -c file:///home/ords/mrd/rpndat/dja001/python_miniconda3/envs/test1/conda-bld/ domutils

- commit everything, push branch to github, open merge/pull request

- check that documentation builds on RTD
  In admin settings, change default to latest and select new branch
  "latest" will be built from that branch
  check if docs renders well
    https://readthedocs.org/projects/domutils


- when all the above worked, 
  add version tag and push to github
   git checkout master
   git pull github master
   git tag -a v2.0.0 -m 'version 2.0.0 with CamelCase removed'
   git push github --tags
  "stable" will be build on RTD





        
        - test the conda package in a fresh conda environment with:
        conda install -c dja001 domutils

        - upgrade domutils in an existing environment with:
        conda upgrade -c dja001 domutils
