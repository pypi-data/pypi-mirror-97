        ## Installation
        
        Getting started with draham is very simple. Just install the package via pip
        
        ```sh
        pip install --user draham
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Because draham pulls its data from the CoinMarketCap API, you will unfortuneraly
        need to create a developer account and generate an API KEY.
        The basic plan is free and affords you 10K calls per month.
        
        draham requires a configuration file in the `ini` format. By default it will look
        for a `.drahamrc` file under your home directory.
        
        Here's how it should look like
        
        ```ini
        [auth]
        api_key=your_api_key_without_quotes
        ```
        
        other (optional) settings include `symbols` and `currency`.
        
        ```ini
        [options]
        ; default symbols are: BTC,BCH,DASH,LTC,ETH,XMR,XRP,BNB
        ; symbols must be separated by a comma. Quotes are not allowed.
        symbols=BTC,ETH,BCH
        
        ; default currency is: USD
        currency=USD
        ```
        
        Currently, draham supports the following currencies:
        
        - 🇩🇿  Algerian Dinar (DZD)
        - 🇺🇸  US Dollar (USD)
        - 🇬🇧  British Pound (GBP)
        - 🇪🇺  Euro (EUR)
        - 🇦🇺 Australian Dollar (AUD)
        - 🇨🇦  Canadian Dollar (CAD)
        - 🇯🇵  Japanese Yen (JPY)
