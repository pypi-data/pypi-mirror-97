# Draham

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

## Installation

Getting started with draham is very simple. Just install the package via pip

```sh
pip install --user draham
```

## Usage

Because draham pulls its data from the CoinMarketCap API, you will unfortuneraly
need to create a developer account and generate an API KEY.
The basic plan is free and affords you 10K calls per month.

draham requires a configuration file in the `ini` format. By default it will look
for a `.drahamrc` file under your home directory.

Here's how it should look like

```ini
[auth]
api_key=your_api_key_without_quotes
```

other (optional) settings include `symbols` and `currency`.

```ini
[options]
; default symbols are: BTC,BCH,DASH,LTC,ETH,XMR,XRP,BNB
; symbols must be separated by a comma. Quotes are not allowed.
symbols=BTC,ETH,BCH

; default currency is: USD
currency=USD
```

## Command line options

* `--tor` - Use tor as a proxy before reaching the API
* `--detailed` - Get a more detailed view of the prices (1h price change, 24h volume, total circulating supply)
* `--config` - specify a path to a custom config file (default is `$HOME/.drahamrc`)


Currently, draham supports the following currencies:

- ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡¿  Algerian Dinar (DZD)
- ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸  US Dollar (USD)
- ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§  British Pound (GBP)
- ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º  Euro (EUR)
- ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º Australian Dollar (AUD)
