Description: # Drop
        ###### *also known as drop-mod*
        Drop is a Python module focused on providing moderation commands for chat-bots (i.e. Discord, Matrix.org, etc.)
        ## How do I install/use it?
        Unfortunately I have not yet made this package a terminal app, so you'll have to use it in scripts (for example, [drop-discord](https://github.com/AtlasC0R3/drop-discord/))
        
        There are 2 ways: either cloning the GitHub repository, or using `pip`
        ### Cloning from GitHub
        1. Clone this repository, [by downloading this repository as a \*.zip file](https://github.com/AtlasC0R3/drop-mod/archive/main.zip), [by cloning this repository using Git](https://github.com/AtlasC0R3/drop-mod.git) or [by going into this repository's releases](https://github.com/AtlasC0R3/drop-mod/releases) and downloading the latest release. If you download from this repository's release, you have the stable release. If you cloned this repository directly, you have a more "canary" release.
        2. Run `setup.py` using your preferred Python installation
        ### Using `pip`
        1. Run `pip install drop-mod`
        
        Drop should be installed *unless `setup.py` threw an error*!
        
        To use it, import `drop` into your Python scripts (or specific commands using `from drop.basic import owofy`) and, well, use them!
        
        Example:
        ```python
        from drop.basic import owofy
        owofy("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.")
        # This is just a simple command to work with, hence why I use it as a prime example.
        # no im not a furry shhHHHHHH.
        ```
        
        ### Dependencies
        **None of these packages listed below are included directly into this software!** They are only installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) when running `setup.py`!
