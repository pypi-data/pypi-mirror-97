class DoubleThompsonSampling(SingleCopelandProducer):
    r"""Implementation of the Double Thompson Sampling algorithm.

    The goal of this algorithm is to find the :term:`Copeland winner` while incurring minimal average :term:`Copeland regret`. If there
    exist a :term:`Condorcet winner`, the :term:`Copeland winner` is also the :term:`Condorcet winner`.

    No further assumptions about the arms are needed.

    It uses the average :term:`Copeland regret`. For the general Copeland winner setting, D-TS achieves :math:`\mathcal{O}(K^2 \log T)`. Meanwhile, For
    the Condorcet setting and many practical Copeland settings, D-TS achieves :math:`\mathcal{O}(K \log T + K^2 \log \log T)`
    using a back substitution argument.

    The Double Thompson Sampling (D-TS) algorithm in paper :cite:`huasen2016dts`
    includes both  the Condorcet and the general Copeland setting. D-TS uses a double sampling structure
    where the first as well as the second candidates are selected according to independently drawn samples
    from the beta posterior distribution and then dueled. The double sampling structure of D-TS is better suited for
    dueling bandits nature. Unlike :class:`RelaviveConfidenceSampling<duelpy.algorithms.RelativeConfidenceSampling>`, launching two independent rounds of sampling provide us the opportunity to
    select the same arm in both rounds. This allows to compare the winners against themselves which significantly
    reduced regret. The confidence bounds in the algorithm are used to eliminate the
    unlikely arms which are ineligible to be winner arm and thus avoids suboptimal comparisons. While selecting the
    first candidate arm and the second candidate arm, the confidence bound is used to eliminate non-likely winners.
    So, D-TS is more robust in practice.

    Parameters

    feedback_mechanism

class DoubleThompsonSamplingPlus(DoubleThompsonSampling):
    r"""Implementation of the extended version of D-TS.

    The goal of this algorithm is to find the Copeland winner while incurring minimal average Copeland regret. If there
    exist a Condorcet winner, the Copeland winner is also the Condorcet winner.

    It is assumed that the Copeland winner exists.

    It uses the average Copeland regret. For the general Copeland bandit, D-TS+ achieves :math:`\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log T)`.
    Meanwhile, for the Condorcet dueling bandit and many practical Copeland dueling bandit, D-TS+ achieves :math:`\mathcal{O}(N
    \log T + N^2 \log \log T)` using a back substitution argument. :math:`N` is the number of arms.

    As presented in :cite:`huasen2016dts`, the D-TS+ algorithm just changes the tie-breaking
    criterion while selecting the first candidate(i.e the selection of the first candidate). During the selection of
    the first candidate , all the potential champions are selected as potential Copeland winners based on an upper
    estimate of the preference probability. Now, To remove the non-likely winners, preference probability between the
    arms is sampled using beta distribution. Then, For all the potential arms, one vs all arm regret based on sampled
    preference is calculated using KL divergence. The arm with minimal one-vs-all regret is selected as a first
    candidate. The one vs all regret of a potential arm is defined by the summation of Copeland regret of a
    respective potential arm with any other arm per KL-divergence (preference of potential arm over another arm, :math:`0.5`).
