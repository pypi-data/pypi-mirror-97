class KnockoutTournament(CondorcetProducer, PacAlgorithm):
    r"""Implementation of the knockout tournament algorithm.

    The goal of this algorithm is to find the :math:`\epsilon`-:term:`Condorcet winner` while minimizing the number of comparisons.

    The algorithm assumes a :term:`total order` over the existing arms and that :term:`strong stochastic transitivity`, :term:`stochastic triangle inequality` and :term:`relaxed stochastic transitivity` hold.

    The amount of pairwise comparisons made by the algorithm is bound  by :math:`\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{N}{\epsilon^2}\left(1+\log\frac{1}{\delta}\right)\right)`, where :math:`N` is the number of arms, :math:`\epsilon` the maximal deviation from the solution and :math:`\delta` is the error probability.

    The algorithm was originally introduced in :cite:`falahatgar2017maximum`. It is an :math:`\epsilon`-:math:`\delta`-:term:`PAC` algorithm. It takes the set of arms as an input and compares them in rounds. At the end of each round, the size of the input is halved.
    The winning arm for a round is decided based on the allowed sub-optimality :math:`\epsilon` and with a confidence interval based on the failure probability.
    The algorithm runs in rounds, where in each round it randomly pairs the arms into group and the winners are proceeded into the next round. For example that we have four arms [A, B, C, D]. It will first group the arms in pairs like [A, B] as the first pair and [C, D] as the second pair. After grouping them in pairs, the algorithm pulls out the winner from each pair, and the winners move to the next round.

    Parameters
    ----------
    feedback_mechanism
        A ``FeedbackMechanism`` object describing the environment.
    time_horizon
         The number of steps that the algorithm is supposed to be run.
    epsilon
        The optimality of the winning arm. Corresponds to :math:`\epsilon` in :cite:`falahatgar2017maximum`. Default value is ``0.05``
        which has been used in the experiments in :cite:`falahatgar2017maximum`.
    failure_probability
        The probability that the result is not an :math:`\epsilon`-:term:`Condorcet winner`. Corresponds to :math:`\delta` in :cite:`falahatgar2017maximum`.
        Default value is ``0.1`` which has been used in the experiments in :cite:`falahatgar2017maximum`.
    stochasticity
        The assumed stochastic transitivity parameter. Corresponds to :math:`\gamma` in :cite:`falahatgar2017maximum`. Default value is
        ``0.6`` which has been used in the experiments in :cite:`falahatgar2017maximum`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    feedback_mechanism
    tournament_arms
        The arms that are still in the tournament.
    epsilon
    failure_probability
    stochasticity
    time_step
         Number of rounds the algorithm has executed.

    Examples
    --------
    Define a preference-based multi-armed bandit problem through a preference
    matrix:

    >>> from duelpy.feedback import MatrixFeedback
    >>> preference_matrix = np.array([
    ...     [0.5, 0.1, 0.1],
    ...     [0.9, 0.5, 0.3],
    ...     [0.9, 0.7, 0.5],
    ... ])
    >>> feedback_mechanism = MatrixFeedback(preference_matrix, random_state=np.random.RandomState(100))
    >>> knockout_tournament = KnockoutTournament(feedback_mechanism, epsilon=0.1, failure_probability=0.3, stochasticity=0.6, time_horizon=300)
    >>> knockout_tournament.run()
    >>> best_arm = knockout_tournament.get_condorcet_winner()
    >>> best_arm
    2
    >>> feedback_mechanism.get_num_duels()
    300

    In this example the :math:`epsilon`-Condorcet winner is the arm with index 2.
