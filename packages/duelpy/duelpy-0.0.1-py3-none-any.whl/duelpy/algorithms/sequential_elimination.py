class SequentialElimination(SingleCopelandProducer, PacAlgorithm):
    r"""Implement the Sequential Elimination algorithm.

    The goal of this algorithm is to find an :math:`\epsilon`-maximum arm.

    The algorithm computes a :term:`PAC` estimation of the :term:`Copeland winner`.
    An arm is :math:`\epsilon`-maximum (where :math:`\epsilon = \epsilon_u-\epsilon_l`), if it is preferable to other arms with
    probability at least :math:`0.5-\epsilon`.

    If the anchor arm provided to the algorithm is a good anchor element, then there are only m elements
    for which element a is not :math:`\epsilon_l` preferable. This means, all other elements will be eliminated but
    among these :math:`m` elements, there can be at most :math:`m` changes of anchor element. Thus, there can be at most m rounds and
    hence we can bound total comparison rounds by :math:`\mathcal{O}(N + m^2)`. :math:`N` is the number of arms.

    Thus this :term:`PAC` algorithm reduces the comparisons to at most m elements which are not :math:`\epsilon_l` preferable and
    the remaining n-m elements are :math:`\epsilon_l` perferable and hence are removed with comparison complexity of
    :math:`\mathcal{O}(N)`.

     Refer to the paper :cite:`falahatgar2017maxing`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    feedback_mechanism
        A ``FeedbackMechanism`` object describing the environment.
    time_horizon
        The number of steps that the algorithm is supposed to be run. Specify ``None`` for an infinite time horizon.
    failure_probability
        Determines the number of iterations that both arms are compared against. Corresponds to :math:`\delta` in
        :cite:`falahatgar2017maxing`. Default value is ``0.1``, as given in section 6.
    epsilon_lower
        Default value is ``0.0``. Refer to section 3.1.1 in :cite:`falahatgar2017maxing`.
    epsilon_upper
        Corresponds to :math:`\epsilon` with default value is ``0.5``, as given in section 3.1.1 in
        :cite:`falahatgar2017maxing`.
    arms_subset
        Represents the list of arms which is sent by other algorithms and is the subset from list of arms
        fetched from ``feedback_mechanism``.
    anchor_arm
        If none is provided, it is selected randomly from the list of arms provided to the algorithm.
        Otherwise, it represents the anchor arm extracted from ``feedback_mechanism.get_arms()``.
        A good anchor element is an arm for which every other arm (being :math:`\epsilon_l` preferable) is deemed worse
        and gets eliminated.

    Attributes
    ----------
    feedback_mechanism
    failure_probability
    preference_estimate

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        Raised when the value of upper epsilon is not greater than lower epsilon.

    Examples
    --------
    Define a preference-based multi-armed bandit problem through a preference
    matrix:

    >>> from duelpy.feedback import MatrixFeedback
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> preference_matrix = np.array([
    ...     [0.5, 0.1, 0.1],
    ...     [0.9, 0.5, 0.5],
    ...     [0.9, 0.5, 0.5],
    ... ])
    >>> feedback_mechanism = MatrixFeedback(preference_matrix, random_state=np.random.RandomState())
    >>> sequential_elimination = SequentialElimination(feedback_mechanism, random_state=np.random.RandomState())
    >>> sequential_elimination.run()
    >>> preferred_arms = [1,2]
    >>> best_arm = sequential_elimination.get_copeland_winner()
    >>> best_arm in preferred_arms
    True

        The calibrated preference probability estimate (:math:`\hat{p}_{i,j}`) for competing arm against anchor arm
        refers to the probability that competing arm is preferred to anchor arm and is calculated based on the number of
        times competing arm has won divided by total number of duels between both arms. This value is updated after each
         duel between them.

        The confidence radius (:math:`\hat{c}`) is calculated such that with proof >= :math:`1-\delta`,
        :math:`\lvert \hat{p}_{i,j} - p_{i,j} \rvert < \hat{c}` after any number of comparisons. Here :math:`1-\delta`
        as mentioned in the paper :cite:`falahatgar2017maxing`, is called confidence value but we have referred it
        as the failure probability.

        The method returns True if :math:`\hat{p}_{i,j}`  :\ge math:`(\epsilon_u + \epsilon_l)/2` otherwise False is
        returned.
