\section{Experience \Dumux by reading -- the \Dumux examples}
As an alternative to going through exercises, you can have a look at our well-documented \Dumux examples in \Dumux's \texttt{examples} directory. They show how to apply \Dumux models to typical physical problems. In the \texttt{README.md} files, the setup is explained, the used code is presented and documented and images resulting from the simulation are included. The \texttt{README.md} files are located directly in the subfolders of \texttt{examples} and can be displayed by web browsers. The number of examples is continuously growing.
You can find a list of current examples under: \url{https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux/-/tree/releases/\DumuxVersion/examples}.
%We currently have the following examples:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item \texttt{1ptracer}: one-phase groundwater flow including a tracer
%	\item \texttt{2pinfiltration}: two-phase infiltration problem
%	\item \texttt{shallowwaterfriction}: steady subcritical shallow water flow including bottom friction
%	\item \texttt{freeflowchannel}: A free-flow problem for flow between two plates
%	\item \texttt{1protationsymmetry}: A 1D rotation-symmetric problem single phase flow problem with a convergence test.
%\end{itemize}
