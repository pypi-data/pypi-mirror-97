Description: # Effmap
        
        Effmap is the python library, which introduces two classes: hydro-static transmission (HST) and regression models (Regressor). The former serves to initialize an HST object for a certain displacement, oil and an engine. Included methods allow to size, to calculate efficiencies as well as performance characteristics for a given operational regime and to create, print and save an efficiency map - a contour or a surface plot for ranges of speeds and torques required. 
        
        The latter class loads the collected catalogue data of displacements, speeds and masses of axial-piston machines from the data.csv file. Then it fits regression models to the data in order to provide inter- and extrapolating predictions. The data and the regression models could then be printed and saved.
        
        ## Installation
        ```
        pip install effmap
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        ```
        from effmap.hst import HST
        from effmap.regressor import Regressor
        
        hst = HST(displ)
        hst.compute_sizes()
        hst.compute_speed_limit(models['pump_speed'])
        hst.load_oil()
        hst.plot_oil()
        hst.compute_eff(input_speed, pressure_discharge)
        hst.compute_loads(pressure_discharge)
        hst.plot_eff_maps(max_speed, max_pressure)
        ```
