        ----
        
        A multigrid solver for 3D electromagnetic diffusion with tri-axial electrical
        anisotropy. The matrix-free solver can be used as main solver or as
        preconditioner for one of the Krylov subspace methods implemented in
        `scipy.sparse.linalg`, and the governing equations are discretized on a
        staggered Yee grid. The code is written completely in Python using the
        NumPy/SciPy-stack, where the most time- and memory-consuming parts are sped up
        through jitted numba-functions.

        Features
        ========
        
        - Multigrid solver for 3D electromagnetic (EM) diffusion with regular grids
          (where source and receiver can be electric or magnetic).
        - Compute the 3D EM field in the complex frequency domain or in the real
          Laplace domain.
        - Includes also routines to compute the 3D EM field in the time domain.
        - Can be used together with the `SimPEG <https://simpeg.xyz>`_-framework.
        - Can be used as a standalone solver or as a pre-conditioner for various Krylov
          subspace methods implemented in SciPy, e.g., BiCGSTAB
          (`scipy.sparse.linalg.bicgstab`) or CGS (`scipy.sparse.linalg.cgs`).
        - Tri-axial electrical anisotropy.
        - Isotropic magnetic permeability.
        - Semicoarsening and line relaxation.
        - Grid-size can be anything.
        - As a multigrid method it scales with the number of unknowns *N* and has
          therefore optimal complexity *O(N)*.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        You can install emg3d either via ``conda`` (preferred):
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
           conda install -c conda-forge emg3d
        
        or via ``pip``:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
           pip install emg3d
        
        Minimum requirements are Python version 3.7 or higher and the modules ``scipy``
        and ``numba``. Various other packages are recommended or required for some
        advanced functionalities (``xarray``, ``discretize``, ``matplotlib``, ``h5py``,
        ``empymod``, ``scooby``). Consult the installation notes in the `manual
        <https://emg3d.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html#installation>`_ for more
        information regarding installation, requirements, and soft dependencies.
