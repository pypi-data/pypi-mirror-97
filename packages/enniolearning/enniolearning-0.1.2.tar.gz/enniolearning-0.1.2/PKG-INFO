Description: # Ennio-Learning
        Ennio is a machine learning program.
        It takes musics in MID format to learn a theme.
        Themes are collections of datasets (collection of MID files) having common features, for example :
        - Heroic fantasy
        - Thriller
        - Horror
        - Suspense
        - Classic
        - Manga
        - etc.
        
        Once learning (training) for one theme is done, the model (network weights) is serialized and can be reused for later music generation.
        Such models are used for instance in [Ennio app project](https://github.com/Mara-tech/Ennio).
        
        ### Training features
        Ennio Learning handles [Jordan](https://github.com/Mara-tech/jordan) features during training and model evaluation. As these are long processes, Jordan app gives remote access to logs (and ETA), and some control over loops. For example, one may skip a training task if it is not going to be efficient (loss is not decreasing).
