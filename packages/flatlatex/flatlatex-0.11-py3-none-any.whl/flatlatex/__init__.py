LaTeX math to Unicode text converter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

flatlatex is a basic converter from LaTeX math to human readable text math
using unicode characters.

Basic example:

    >>> import flatlatex
    >>> c = flatlatex.converter()
    >>> c.convert(
    ... (
    ...     r'\\forall \\eta>0\\, \\exists n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\, \\forall i>n\\,'
    ...     r' |u_i-\\mathcal{l}|<\\eta'
    ... ))
    '‚àÄŒ∑>0 ‚àÉn‚àà‚Ñï ‚àÄi>n |u·µ¢-ùìµ|<Œ∑'

Commands can be added with LaTeX syntax:

    >>> import flatlatex
    >>> c = flatlatex.converter()
    >>> c.add_newcommand(r'\\newcommand\\prob{\\mathbb{P}}')
    >>> c.add_newcommand(r'\\newcommand\\binom[2]{\\frac{#2!}{#1!(#2-#1)!}}')
    >>> c.convert(r'\\prob(X=k)\\,=\\,\\binom{k}{n}\\times p^k(1-p)^{n-k}')
    '‚Ñô(X=k) = (n!)/(k!(n-k)!)√óp·µè(1-p)‚Åø‚Åª·µè'

The behavior can be change:

    >>> import flatlatex
    >>> c = flatlatex.converter()
    >>> c.convert(r'\\frac{8}{9}')
    '‚Å∏‚ÅÑ‚Çâ'
    >>> c.allow_zw = False
    >>> c.convert(r'\\frac{8}{9}')
    '8/9'
