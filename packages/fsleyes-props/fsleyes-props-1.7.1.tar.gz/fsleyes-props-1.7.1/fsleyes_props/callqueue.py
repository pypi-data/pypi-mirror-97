class CallQueue(object):
    """A queue of functions to be called. Functions can be enqueued via
    the :meth:`call` or :meth:`callAll` methods.
    """

    def __init__(self, skipDuplicates=False):
        """Create a ``CallQueue`` instance.

        If ``skipDuplicates`` is ``True``, a function which is already on
        the queue will be silently dropped if an attempt is made to add it
        again.

          .. note::

             The ``skipDuplicates`` test is based solely on the name of the
             function. This means that the ``CallQueue`` does not support
             enqueueing the same function with different arguments.

             Testing for function *and* argument equality is a difficult task:

               - I can't take the hash of the arguments, as I can't assume
                 that they are hashable (e.g.  ``numpy`` arrays).

               - I can't test for identity, as things which have the same
                 value may not have the same id (e.g. strings).

               - I can't test argument equality, because in some cases the
                 argument may be a mutable type (e.g. a ``list``), and its
                 value may have changed between the time the function was
                 queued, and the time it is called. *And* the arguments might
                 be big (again, ``numpy`` arrays), so an equality test could
                 be expensive.

             So this is quite a pickle. Something to come back to if things
             are breaking because of it.


        **Holding the queue**


        The :meth:`hold` method temporarily stops the ``CallQueue`` from
        queueing and executing functions. Any functions which are enqueued
        while the queue is held are kept in a separate queue. The queue is
        released via the :meth:`release` method, after which any held
        functions may be accessed via the :meth:`clearHeld` method (which
        also clears the internal queue of held functions). Once the queue
        has been released, these held functions can be re-queued as normal
        via the :meth:`call` or :meth:`callAll` methods.
