# gemini_builder

This Python package makes creation of Gemini text documents for
[Project Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) a little
easier.

To create a document, instantiate the Page class and add lines
using the appropriate methods. Finally, you can convert the
page to a string, print it, etc.
