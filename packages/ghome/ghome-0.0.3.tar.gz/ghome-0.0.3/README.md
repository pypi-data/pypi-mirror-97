# ghome: Simple CLI for Google Home & Mini
This is an application of the google home API Blueprint reported [here](https://github.com/rithvikvibhu/GHLocalApi). While a lot of the end points maybe of interest to quite a few people, I used the ones I use most and I thought would be most useful and created a command line tool for you to search for a Google home mini device and then use this tool to interact with it and perform actions as needed. A large thanks goes to both [rithvikvibhu](https://github.com/rithvikvibhu) for the blueprint and finally to [leikoilja](https://github.com/leikoilja) for excellent work on implementing [glocaltokens](https://github.com/leikoilja/glocaltokens).

## Installation
This assumes that you have native python & pip installed in your system, you can test this by going to the terminal (or windows command prompt) and trying. On a windows machine , install pycryptodomex first by using the [instructions here](https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/installation.html#windows-from-sources-python-3-5-and-newer)

This also includes following importantly
**Download [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2019). In the installer, select the C++ build tools, the Windows 10 SDK, and the latest version of MSVC v142 x64/x86 build tools.**

```python``` and then ```pip list```

If you get no errors and you have python 3.6 or higher you should be good to go

To install **ghome: Simple CLI for Google Home & Mini** you can install using two methods.

```pip install ghome```

or you can also try

```
git clone https://github.com/samapriya/ghome.git
cd ghome
python setup.py install
```
For Linux use sudo or try ```pip install ghome --user```.

The advantage of having it installed is that ghome can be executed as any command line tool. I recommend installation within a virtual environment. .


## Getting started

As usual, to print help:

```
usage: ghome [-h]
             {auth,device_list,devinfo,reboot,alarm_list,alarm_volume,alarm_delete,bstat,bscan,bpaired,bdisc,wscan,saved_network}

To obtain help for specific functionality, simply call it with _help_ switch, e.g.: `ghome wscan -h`. If you didn't install ghome, then you can run it just by going to *ghome* directory and running `python ghome.py [arguments go here]`

## ghome Simple CLI for Earth Engine Uploads
The tool is based on currently unofficial API blueprint published for the device and is subject to change in the future.

### auth
This tool is originally based on the implementation of glocaltokens from the [gist](https://gist.github.com/rithvikvibhu/952f83ea656c6782fbd0f1645059055d). This should be used only once as suggested on the [glocaltokens site](https://github.com/leikoilja/glocaltokens) and is to avoid Google delinking devices or anything else. The auth tool create a config-file and write a master authentication token which can be used by the tool to then generate local device tokens as they expire every 24 hours.

``` ghome auth ```

### device_list
This tool generates a list of all google home devices connected to your network and prints the name and ip address of each. This is a quick way to check specific name or ip address to use for a device.

``` ghome device_list ```

### device_info
This tool uses device name or ip addrss to get all information available for said device and prints it out as a json object.
