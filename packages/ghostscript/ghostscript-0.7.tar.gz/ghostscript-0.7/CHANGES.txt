Changes
==================

0.7 (2021-03-06)
----------------

* BREAKING: ``Ghostscript()`` no longer allows passing arbitrary
  keyword arguments.

* The high-level interface now allows passing unicode strings as
  arguments. Passing bytes as arguments is still possible, but now
  deprecated.

* The high-level interface now requires ghostscript >= 9.0.8 (released
  2013-08-14).

* Allow multiple Ghostscript instances. Actually using this requires
  the library is compiled with -DGS_THREADSAFE.

* Ensure proper clean-up on error.

* High-level revision() now returns unicode strings instead of byte
  strings.

* Add low-level interface for set_arg_encoding().

* Miscellaneous small fixes.

* Drop support for Python 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5.
  Minimum required Python version is now 3.6.


:0.6 (2018-01-16):

  * Add support for Python 3.x (tested with Python 3.4).
    Minimum required Python version is now 2.7.

  * Add support for display callback and an example program
    using it. Thanks to Lasse Fister.

  * Add context-interface (for the ``with``-statement).

  * ``GhostscriptError`` now has an attribute ``code`` holding
    the numeric error-code.

  * ``Ghostscript()`` now accepts keyword-arguments ``stdin``,
    ``stdout``, ``stderr`` for setting the respective stream. This was
    already implementd in version 0.4.1, but not documented.

  * Add unittest suite (using pytest).

  * Several bug fixes and smaller changes.

  * Switch version control to git and move project to gitlab. See
    Readme-file for the new URL.

  * Set up continuous integration tests.


:0.5 (skipped):

   * v0.5 was skipped to avoid version conflicts with fork
     `python3-ghostscript`. All changes of that fork are integrated
     into v0.6.


:0.4.1 (2011-02-09):

  * Fixed import module on Windows XP. Thanks to Akihiro Takizawa for
    the patch.

:0.4 (2011-01-29):

  * Fixed typo in function call name ctypes.util.find_library

  * (Unix) No longer try to load a specific version (version 8) of
    libgs.so

  * Added low-level interface for set_stdio() plus wrappers for
    file handles

  * (win32) Improved search for best Ghostscript installation:
    Consider Aladdin and GNU Ghostscript, too; Check for existence of
    DLL found in registry; take highest version available.

  * Added win32 example-batch file for testing and other
    improvements/fixes on examples an documentation.

:0.3 (2010-08-12):

  * Added support for win32: The DLL to load is searched in registry.

  * On other platforms: Be more inteligent about finding Ghostscript
    shared object file (fall back to ctypes.util.find_library() if
    `libgs.8.so` can not be loaded

  * Better error messages if lib/dll is not found.

  * Removed relative imports, so older versions of Python can be used.

  * Added nice project logo

:0.2 (2010-08-06):

  * Fixed several bugs, esp. for running strings by Ghostscript.

:0.1 (2010-08-06):

  * This is the first public release of the Python Ghostscript C-API
    interface.
