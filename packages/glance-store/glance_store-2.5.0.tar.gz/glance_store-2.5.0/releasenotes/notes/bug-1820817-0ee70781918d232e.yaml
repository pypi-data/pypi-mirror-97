    Swift backend now can use custom CA bundle to verify SSL connection to
    Keystone without adding this bundle to global system ones.
    For this it re-uses the CA bundle specified as ``swift_store_cacert``
    config option, so this bundle must verify both certificates of Swift and
    Keysotne API endpoints.
