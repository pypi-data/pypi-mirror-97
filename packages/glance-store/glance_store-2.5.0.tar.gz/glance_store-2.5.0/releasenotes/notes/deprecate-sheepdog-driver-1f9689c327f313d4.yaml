deprecations:
  - |
    The Sheepdog driver is deprecated in this release and is subject to
    removal at the beginning of the 'U' development cycle, following the
    `OpenStack standard deprecation policy
    <https://governance.openstack.org/reference/tags/assert_follows-standard-deprecation.html>`_.

    The driver is being removed because `Sheepdog is not maintained upstream
    <http://lists.wpkg.org/pipermail/sheepdog/2019-March/068451.html>`_.
    Additionally, the Sheepdog driver is no longer tested in the OpenStack
    gate.
