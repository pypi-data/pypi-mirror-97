deprecations:
  - |
    The glance_store function ``store_add_to_backend``, which is a
    wrapper around each store's ``add()`` method, is deprecated in this
    release and is subject to removal at the beginning of the Stein
    development cycle, following the `OpenStack standard deprecation policy
    <https://governance.openstack.org/reference/tags/assert_follows-standard-deprecation.html>`_.

    The function is replaced by ``store_add_to_backend_with_multihash``,
    which is a similar wrapper, but which takes an additional argument
    allowing a caller to specify an secure hashing algorithm.  The
    hexdigest of this algorithm is returned as one of the multiple
    values returned by the function.  The function also returns the
    md5 checksum for backward compatability.
