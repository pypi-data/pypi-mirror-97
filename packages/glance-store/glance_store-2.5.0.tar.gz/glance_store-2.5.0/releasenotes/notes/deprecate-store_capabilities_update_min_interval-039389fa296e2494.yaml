deprecations:
  - |
    The glance_store configuration option
    ``store_capabilities_update_min_interval`` is deprecated in this
    release and is subject to removal at the beginning of the Stein
    development cycle, following the `OpenStack standard deprecation policy
    <https://governance.openstack.org/reference/tags/assert_follows-standard-deprecation.html>`_.

    The option configures a stub method that has not been implemented
    for any existing store drivers.  Hence it is non-operational.  Given
    that it has *never* been operational, it will not be missed.  Its
    presence is confusing to operators and thus it is hereby deprecated
    for removal.
