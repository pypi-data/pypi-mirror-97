    Add new configuration option ``rbd_thin_provisioning`` and
    ``filesystem_thin_provisioning`` to rbd and filesystem
    store to enable or not sparse upload, default are False.

    A sparse file means that we do not actually write null byte sequences
    but only the data itself at a given offset, the "holes" which can
    appear will automatically be interpreted by the storage backend as
    null bytes, and do not really consume your storage.

    Enabling this feature will also speed up image upload and save
    network traffic in addition to save space in the backend, as null
    bytes sequences are not sent over the network.
