    This release contains the base work for multiple back-ends changing how
    the back-ends get configured. Please note that in Rocky release the work
    is still experimental. Thus it's not advised to utilize the new configs in
    production environments before Stein release even though old config options
    are deprecated for removal.
features:

    EXPERIMENTAL: Multiple back-end stores
deprecations:
  - |
    'stores' and 'default_store' config options have been deprecated for
    removal. As the replacements are experimental for Rocky release, migration
