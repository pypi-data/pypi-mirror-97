upgrade:
  - If using Swift in the multi-tenant mode for storing
    images in Glance, please note that the configuration
    options ``swift_store_multi_tenant`` and
    ``swift_store_config_file`` are now mutually exclusive
    and cannot be configured together. If you intend to
    use multi-tenant store, please make sure that you have
    not set a swift configuration file.
