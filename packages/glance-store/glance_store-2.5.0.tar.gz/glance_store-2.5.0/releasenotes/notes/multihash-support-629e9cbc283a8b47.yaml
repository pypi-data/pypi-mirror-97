    A new function, ``store_add_to_backend_with_multihash``, has been
    added.  This function wraps each store's ``add`` method to provide
    consumers with a constant interface.  It is similar to the existing
    ``store_add_to_backend`` function but requires the caller to
    specify an additional ``hashing_algo`` argument whose value is
    a hashlib algorithm identifier.  The function returns a 5-tuple
    containing a ``multihash`` value, which is a hexdigest of the
    stored data computed using the specified hashing algorithm.
