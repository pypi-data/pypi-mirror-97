    In this version, refactor was made how registering of filesystem
    configuration options for reserved stores works. Consumer just
    need to pass the key:value pair where key represents the name of the
    reserved store and value represents the actual store driver, to the
    glance_store.

    At the moment use of reserved stores is only limited to filesystem store
    driver. Also default ``filesystem_store_datadir`` path for these stores
    is set to ``/var/lib/glance/<store_name>``, so with if you are using
    devstack for the deployment, you need to make sure you have appropriate
    permissions to create these reserved stores directories.
