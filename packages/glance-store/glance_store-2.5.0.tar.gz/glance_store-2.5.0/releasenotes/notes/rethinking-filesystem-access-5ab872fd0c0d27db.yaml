    Added keyword argument to ``register_store_opts`` and
    ``create_multi_stores`` calls to configure reserved stores by the consuming
    service. This feature will allow a mix of operator-configured stores via
    enabled_backends configuration option set in the [glance_store] section
    of the consuming service's configuration file, and stores that are
    reserved for use by the consuming service.
