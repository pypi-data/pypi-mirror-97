prelude: >
    Return list of store drivers in sorted order for
    generating configs. More info in ``Upgrade Notes``
    and ``Bug Fixes`` section.
upgrade:
  - This version of glance_store will result in Glance
    generating the configs in a sorted (deterministic)
    order. So, preferably store releases on or after this
    should be used for generating any new configs if the
    mismatched ordering of the configs results in an issue
    in your environment.
fixes:
  - Bug 1619487 is fixed which was causing random order of
    the generation of configs in Glance. See ``upgrade``
    section for more details.
