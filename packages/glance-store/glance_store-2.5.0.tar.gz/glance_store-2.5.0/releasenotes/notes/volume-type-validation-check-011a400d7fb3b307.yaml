upgrade:
  - |
    Previously, during service startup, the check to validate volume types
    used to raise ``BackendException`` or ``BadStoreConfiguration`` exceptions
    when an invalid volume type was configured hence failing the service
    startup. It now logs a warning and the glance service starts normally.
fixes:
  - |
    `Bug #1915163 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance-store/+bug/1915163>`_:
    Added handling to log and raise proper exception during image create when
    an invalid volume type is configured.
