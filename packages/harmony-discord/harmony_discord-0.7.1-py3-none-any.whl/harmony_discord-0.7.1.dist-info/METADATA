Harmony
=======

Version 0.7.1

Harmony is a free/libre program that allows you to perform various actions with
the messaging service `Discord`_. Currently, it allows you to:

* Create an account
* Verify your email address
* View your account tag
* Change your username, email address, password, and avatar
* Change safety and privacy settings
* List servers you’re in and members in those servers
* Transfer and delete servers you own
* Accept server invites
* Delete your account

Actions that require you to complete a CAPTCHA (often required when logging in
from a new location, for example) are supported by using `librecaptcha`_.

For free/libre software that allows you to send and receive messages with
Discord, check out `purple-discord`_.

Installation
------------

From PyPI
~~~~~~~~~

Install with `pip`_::

    sudo pip3 install harmony-discord

To install locally, run without ``sudo`` and add the ``--user`` option.


From the Git repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clone the repository with the following commands (you’ll need to have `Git`_
installed)::

    git clone https://github.com/taylordotfish/harmony
    cd harmony

Then install with `pip`_::

    sudo pip3 install .

To install locally, run without ``sudo`` and add the ``--user`` option.


Run without installing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the first set of commands in the previous section to clone the repository.
Then, install the required dependencies by running::

    sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt

To install the dependencies locally, run without ``sudo`` and add ``--user``.

.. _Git: https://git-scm.com


Usage
-----

If you installed Harmony, simply run ``harmony``, or see ``harmony -h`` for
more options. If you didn’t install it, use ``./harmony.py`` instead of
``harmony``.

If an action requires you to solve a CAPTCHA, Harmony will use
`librecaptcha`_’s GTK 3 GUI, if available, unless the environment variable
``LIBRECAPTCHA_NO_GUI`` is set to a non-empty string.
