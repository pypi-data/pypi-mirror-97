        HAROS is a framework for quality assurance of ROS-based code, mostly based on static analysis.
        
        *Static analysis* consists on **extracting information** from the source code **without executing** it (and, sometimes, even without compiling it).
        The kind of properties that can be verified include simple conformity checks, such as checking whether a variable is initialised, to more complex properties, such as functional behaviour of the program.
        This allows **early detection of problems** in the software development life cycle, which would otherwise go unnoticed into later stages or even into production.
        
        Needless to say, sometimes in robotics it is very hard (or very expensive) to properly test software, not to talk about possible risks.
        Hence the appeal of static analysis.
        
        There is a demo page of the HAROS visualizer available on [GitHub](https://git-afsantos.github.io/haros) and a (slightly outdated) demo video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1JbzvaS3J4).
        
        ## Current Status
        
        HAROS is still being developed, as of January 2021.
        
        ## Installing
        
        To install HAROS, make sure that you have Python 2.7 or greater.
        Simply run the command:
        
        ```
        pip install haros
        ```
        
        For alternative methods, and to install external dependencies required for some features, see [INSTALL](./INSTALL.md).
        
        ## How to Use
        
        See [USAGE](./docs/USAGE.md) for basic commands and usage instructions.
        
        ## Bugs, Questions and Support
        
        Check whether your question has an answer in the [FAQ](./docs/FAQ.md).
        
        Please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/git-afsantos/haros/issues) for issues or feature requests directly related to HAROS.
        
        For issues related to plugins, please use the respective plugin repository.
        
        If you run into errors, or feel that something is not working, run HAROS in debug mode, so the log files do not miss any information, e.g.,
        
        ```
        haros --debug analyse ...
        ```
        
        Then, you can share the log file, found by default within `~/.haros/log.txt`.
