# Introduction

This documentation covers the usage of the Hosty.Page CLI

# Installation

```shell
pip install hostypage
```

The CLI can be installed with `pip`

# Quick start

```shell
# Create a new site
hostypage publish index.html
```

To publish a site on Hosty.Page, simply call `hostypage publish`, specifying a path to a local HTML 
or zip file. Once the Hosty.Page CLI uploads your file, it will deploy your files to a CDN and return
a URL in the format `https://randomstring.hosty.page`. This site will be live for 24 hours, before it 
expires and will be removed.

# Authentication

```shell
# Sending API key with single request:
hostypage publish --api_key myapikey [...args]
```

```shell
# Storing the API key locally for future re-use:
hostypage set-api-key myapikey
```

In order to use the premimum features of Hosty.Page, you will need to authenticate. For free users, there is no need 
to authorize requests. To obtain an API key, you'll need to register for an account at 
<a href="https://hosty.page">Hosty.Page</a>.

Once you have created an account, you can view/change it on the <a href="https://hosty.page/dashboard">Dashboard</a>.

Once you have a valid API key, you can either send it with every single request to the API by passing the `--api-key` 
parameter, or store it locally using the `set-api-key` command.


# More publishing options

## Custom domains

```shell
# Publish to `randomstring.example.com`
hostypage publish index.html --domain example.com
``` 

If you have a custom domain, you can pass the `--domain` option to the CLI to publish your
site to this domain.

## Subdomains

```shell
# Publish to `customsubdomain.hosty.page`
hostypage publish index.html --subdomain customsubdomain
``` 

Similar to custom domains, it's also possible to publish to a specific subdomain using the
Hosty.Page CLI, by simply passing the `--subdomain argument`.

It's also possible to combine the `--subdomain` and `--domain` parameters to specify
exactly where you want your site to be published.

## Expiry


```shell
# Change expiry to 1 week (168 hours)
hostypage publish index.html --expiry 168

# Site never expires
hostypage publish index.html --no-expiry
```

Hosty.Page lets you customize the expiry of your published sites, or to remove the expiry 
completely so that sites remain live until they are manually deleted. If you do not provide
an expiry option, all published sites will expire and be deleted after 24 hours.

You can change the expiry duration by providing an expiry value, in hours, using the
`--expiry` parameter.

To remove the expiry completely, you can pass the `--no-expiry` parameter.

You may not pass both the `--expiry` and `--no-expiry` fields simultaneously
