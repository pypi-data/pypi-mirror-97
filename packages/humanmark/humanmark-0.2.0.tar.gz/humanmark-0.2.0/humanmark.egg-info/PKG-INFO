Description: # HumanMark
        
        A human-friendly markdown *generator*. Accidentally also really useful for
        manipulating existing markdown.
        
        ## 📝 Parse & Modify Markdown
        
        Editing existing markdown is trivial. Maybe we want to uppercase every
        header:
        
        ```python
        from humanmark import loads, Header, (text
        
        fragment = loads('''# Hello World!
        
        This is a sample document.
        ''')
        
        for text in fragment.find(Header / Text):
            text.content = text.content.upper()
        
        fragment.pprint()
        ```
        
        Maybe we wanted to make sure we'd only edit top-level headers. We would just
        add a filter to our `find()`:
        
        ```python
        headers = fragment.find(Header, f=lambda header: header.level == 1)
        ```
        
        ## 🙈 Why?
        
        Manually updating a [Awesome-style][] project's README.md sucks. Dead links,
        unsorted, royal pain to add and update star and fork counts, etc. So I
        created a meta-project, Awesome^2, to generate these README.md files
        automatically from an index.yaml. Originally, this just used a [Jinja2][]
        template to output the markdown, which sucked. Getting line wrapping and
        whitespace correct was non-trivial. So, made a generator.
        
        Then I realized I'd need to parse markdown anyways, both to support having
        extra markdown in the header and footers of an index.yaml, and to ease
        conversion of existing README.md files to an index.yaml. So, made the
        generator bi-directional.
        
        ## ⚗ Testing
        
        HumanMark has good test coverage via pytest. Install the extras with:
        
            pip install -e ".[tests]"
            pip install -e ".[cli]"
        
        ... and run the tests with:
        
            pytest
