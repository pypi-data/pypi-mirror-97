        # What is Hydration?
        Hydration is a library used to define python objects that can be converted to (and from) bytes.
        
        ## Installation
        ```
        pip install hydration
        ```
        
        ## Introduction
        
        <i>This guide assumes you are familiar with low-level primitive data types (like signed/unsigned int, int64, etc.) </i>
        
        ### Field
        Fields are primitive objects that hold data, 
        and can be converted to (and from) bytes:
        ```pycon
        >>> from hydration import *
        >>> f = UInt16(1512)
        >>> bytes(f)
        b'\xe8\x05'
        >>> UInt16().from_bytes(b'\xe8\x05')
        UInt16(1512)
        ```
        
        ### Struct
        A struct is a composite of fields. 
        To create a struct, Inherit from `Struct`:
        ```python
        from hydration import *
        
        class MyStruct(Struct):
            a = UInt8
            b = UInt8(value=3)  # You can set the default value
        ```
        
        ```pycon
        >>> st = MyStruct(a=10)  # Structs can receive field values as keyword arguments
        >>> print(st) 
        MyStruct
            a:	UInt8(10)
            b:	UInt8(3)
        >>> bytes(st)
        b'\n\x03'
        >>> print(MyStruct.from_bytes(b'\n\x03'))
        MyStruct:
        	a:	UInt8(10)
        	b:	UInt8(3)
        ```
        
        ### Message
        A message is a list-like composite of structs:
        ```python
        from hydration import *
        
        class Header(Struct):
            magic = UInt32(0xDEADBEEF)
        
        class Body(Struct):
            param1 = Float(2.875)
            param2 = Int8(-128)
        ```
        ```pycon
        >>> msg = Header() / Body()  # Create a message by using the division operator on structs
        >>> print(msg)
        Header:
        	magic:	UInt32(3735928559)
        Body:
        	param1:	Float(2.875)
        	param2:	Int8(-128)
        >>> bytes(msg)
        b'\xef\xbe\xad\xde\x00\x008@\x80'
        ```
