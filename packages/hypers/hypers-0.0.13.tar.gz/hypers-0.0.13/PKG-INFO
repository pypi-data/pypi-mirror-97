        hypers provides a data structure in python for hyperspectral data. The data structure includes:
        
        + Tools for processing and exploratory analysis of hyperspectral data
        + Interactive hyperspectral viewer (using PyQt) that can be accessed as a method from the object
        + Allows for unsupervised machine learning directly on the object
        
        The data structure is built on top of the numpy `ndarray`, and this package simply adds additional functionality that 
        allows for quick analysis of hyperspectral data. Importantly, this means that the object can still be used as a 
        normal numpy array.

        **Please note that this package is currently in pre-release. It can still be used, however there is likely to be 
        significant changes to the API. The first public release will be v0.1.0.**

        ## Installation
        To install using `pip`:
        ```
        pip install hypers
        ```
        
        The following packages will also be installed:
        
        + numpy
        + scipy
        + PyQt5
        + pyqtgraph
        
        ## Features
        Features implemented in ``hypers`` include:
        
        + Hyperspectral viewer
        + Vertex component analysis
        + Abundance mapping
        
        A full list of features can be found [here](http://hypers.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
        	
        ## Examples
        
        ### Interactive viewer
        The interactive viewer can be particularly helpful for exploring a completely new dataset for the first time to get 
        a feel for the type of data you are working with. An example from a coherent anti-Stokes Raman (CARS) dataset is 
        shown below:
