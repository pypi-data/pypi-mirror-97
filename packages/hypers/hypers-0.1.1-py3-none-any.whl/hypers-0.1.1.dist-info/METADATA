hypers provides a data structure in python for hyperspectral data. The data structure includes:

+ Tools for processing and exploratory analysis of hyperspectral data
+ Interactive hyperspectral viewer (using PyQt) that can be accessed as a method from the object
+ Allows for unsupervised machine learning directly on the object

The data structure is built on top of the numpy `ndarray`, and this package simply adds additional functionality that 
allows for quick analysis of hyperspectral data. Importantly, this means that the object can still be used as a 
normal numpy array.

**Please note that this package is currently in pre-release. It can still be used, however there is likely to be 
significant changes to the API. The first public release will be v0.1.0.**

```

The following packages will also be installed:

+ numpy

+ PyQt5
+ pyqtgraph

## Features
Features implemented in ``hypers`` include:

+ Hyperspectral viewer
+ Vertex component analysis
+ Abundance mapping

A full list of features can be found [here](http://hypers.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Examples

### Interactive viewer
The interactive viewer can be particularly helpful for exploring a completely new dataset for the first time to get 
a feel for the type of data you are working with. An example from a coherent anti-Stokes Raman (CARS) dataset is 
shown below:
