# HypIgu

HypIgu (HYPerplane IGUsa) is a SageMath package that provides functions to compute the Igusa local zeta function associated with hyperplane arrangements. It further contains various constructions of hyperplane arrangements and functions to compute their flag Hilbert&ndash;Poincar√© series and other zeta functions. 

## Installation & Setup

The simplest way to install HypIgu in Sage is by running (SOON!)

```bash
$ sage -pip install hypigu
```
