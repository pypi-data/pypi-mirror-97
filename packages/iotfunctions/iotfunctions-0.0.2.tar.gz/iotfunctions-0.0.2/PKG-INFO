        # IoT Functions
        
        A companion package to IBM Watson IoT Platform Analytics containing sample functions and base classes from which to derive custom functions.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        These instructions will get you up and running in your local environment or in Watson Studio for development and testing purposes. 
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
         + python 3.X (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
         + future (pip install future)
         + pandas (pip install pandas)
         + sqlalchemy (pip install sqlalchemy)
         + ibm_db_sa (pip install ibm_db_sa)
         + ibm_cos_sdk (pip install ibm-cos-sdk)
         + lxml (pip install lxml)
        
        ### Build and Shipment
        
        **Caveat**
        - Shipping to pypi or test-pypi requires a token
        - Version numbers can never be reused.
        
        1. Build a distribution first
            ```
            python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
            ```
        2. Upload to test-pypi
            ```
            twine upload --verbose --repository testpypi dist/*
            ```
        3. When everything appears to be okay upload to pypi
            ```
            twine upload --verbose --repository pypi dist/*
            ```
        
        ### Installing
        
        1. Create a virtual environment
            ```
            python3 -m venv env
            ```
        2. Activate virtual environment
            ```
            source env/bin/activate
            ```
        3. Install in your local environment from GitHub
           ```
           pip install git+git://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/functions@production --upgrade 
           ```
        
        To install in IBM Watson Studio from another Jupyter notebook:
        
        ```~~~bash
        !pip install git+git://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/functions.git@production --upgrade
        ```
        
        Test for successful install:
        
        ```~~~python3
        import iotfunctions as fn
        print(fn.__version__) 
        ```
