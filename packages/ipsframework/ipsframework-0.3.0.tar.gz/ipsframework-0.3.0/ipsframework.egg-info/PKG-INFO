Description: # Integrated Plasma Simulator (IPS) Framework
        
        The IPS was originally developed for the SWIM project and is designed
        for coupling plasma physics codes to simulate the interactions of
        various heating methods on plasmas in a tokamak. The physics goal of
        the project is to better understand how the heating changes the
        properties of the plasma and how these heating methods can be used to
        improve the stability of plasmas for fusion energy production.
        
        The IPS framework is thus designed to couple standalone codes flexibly
        and easily using python wrappers and file-based data coupling. These
        activities are not inherently plasma physics related and the IPS
        framework can be considered a general code coupling framework. The
        framework provides services to manage:
        
         - the orchestration of the simulation through component invocation,
            task launch and asynchronous event notification mechanisms
         - configuration of complex simulations using familiar syntax
         - file communication mechanisms for shared and internal (to a
            component) data, as well as checkpoint and restart capabilities
        
        The framework performs the task, configuration, file and resource
        management, along with the event service, to provide these features.
