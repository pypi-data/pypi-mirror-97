The Isso configuration file is an \fI\%INI\-style\fP textfile. It reads integers,
booleans, strings and lists. Here\(aqs the default isso configuration:
\fIisso.conf <https://github.com/posativ/isso/blob/master/share/isso.conf>\fP\&. A
basic configuration from scratch looks like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

.ft C

dbpath = /var/lib/isso/comments.db
host = https://example.tld/
[server]
listen = http://localhost:1234/
.ft P

To use your configuration file with Isso, append \fB\-c /path/to/cfg\fP to the
executable or run Isso with an environment variable:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.SH GENERAL
.sp
In this section, you configure most comment\-related options such as database path,
session key and hostname. Here are the default values for this section:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[general]
dbpath = /tmp/isso.db
name =
host =
max\-age = 15m
notify = stdout
log\-file =
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B dbpath
file location to the SQLite3 database, highly recommended to change this
location to a non\-temporary location!
.TP
.B name
required to dispatch multiple websites,
not used otherwise.
.TP
.B host
Your website(s). If Isso is unable to connect to at least one site, you\(aqll
get a warning during startup and comments are most likely non\-functional.
.sp
You\(aqll need at least one host/website to run Isso. This is due to security
reasons: Isso uses \fI\%CORS\fP to embed comments and to restrict comments only to
your website, you have to "whitelist" your website(s).
.sp
I recommend the first value to be a non\-SSL website that is used as fallback
if Firefox users (and only those) supress their HTTP referer completely.
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[general]
host =
    http://example.tld/
    https://example.tld/
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B max\-age
time range that allows users to edit/remove their own comments. See
\fI\%Appendum: Timedelta\fP for valid values.
.TP
.B notify
Select notification backend(s) for new comments, separated by comma.
Available backends:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B stdout
Log to standard output. Default, if none selected. Note, this
functionality is broken since a few releases.
.TP
.B smtp
Send notifications via SMTP on new comments with activation (if
moderated) and deletion links.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B reply\-notifications
Allow users to request E\-mail notifications for replies to their post.
.sp
It is highly recommended to also turn on moderation when enabling this
setting, as Isso can otherwise be easily exploited for sending spam.
.sp
Do not forget to configure the client accordingly.
.TP
.B log\-file
Log console messages to file instead of standard out.
.TP
.B gravatar
When set to \fBtrue\fP this will add the property "gravatar_image"
containing the link to a gravatar image to every comment. If a comment
does not contain an email address, gravatar will render a random icon.
This is only true when using the default value for "gravatar\-url"
which contains the query string param \fBd=identicon\fP ...
.TP
.B gravatar\-url
Url for gravatar images. The "{}" is where the email hash will be placed.
Defaults to "\fI\%https://www.gravatar.com/avatar\fP/{}?d=identicon"
.TP
.B latest\-enabled
If True it will enable the \fB/latest\fP endpoint. Optional, defaults
to False.
.UNINDENT

Enable moderation queue and handling of comments still in moderation queue
.INDENT 0.0

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B enabled
enable comment moderation queue. This option only affects new comments.
Comments in moderation queue are not visible to other users until you
activate them.
.TP
.B approve\-if\-email\-previously\-approved
automatically approve comments by an email address if that address has
had a comment approved within the last 6 months. No ownership verification
is done on the entered email address. This means that if someone is able
to guess correctly the email address used by a previously approved author,
they will be able to have their new comment auto\-approved.
.TP
.B purge\-after
remove unprocessed comments in moderation queue after given time.
.UNINDENT
.SH SERVER

When \fBgevent\fP is available, it is automatically used for \fIhttp://\fP
Currently, gevent can not handle http requests on unix domain socket
(see \fI\%#295\fP and
\fI\%#299\fP for details).
.sp
Does not apply for \fIuWSGI\fP\&.
.TP
.B public\-endpoint
public URL that Isso is accessed from by end users. Should always be
a \fI\%http://\fP or \fI\%https://\fP absolute address. If left blank, automatic
detection is attempted. Normally only needs to be specified if
different than the \fIlisten\fP setting.
.TP
.B reload
reload application, when the source code has changed. Useful for
development. Only works with the internal webserver.
.TP
.B profile
show 10 most time consuming function in Isso after each request. Do
not use in production.
.TP
.B trusted\-proxies
an optional list of reverse proxies IPs behind which you have deployed
your Isso web service (e.g. \fI127.0.0.1\fP).
This allow for proper remote address resolution based on a
\fIX\-Forwarded\-For\fP HTTP header, which is important for the mechanism
forbiding several comment votes coming from the same subnet.
.UNINDENT
.SH SMTP
.sp
Isso can notify you on new comments via SMTP. In the email notification, you
also can moderate (=activate or delete) comments. Don\(aqt forget to configure
\fBnotify = smtp\fP in the general section.

.TP
.B security
use a secure connection to the server, possible values: \fInone\fP, \fIstarttls\fP
or \fIssl\fP\&. Note, that there is no easy way for Python 2.7 and 3.3 to
implement certification validation and thus the connection is vulnerable to
Man\-in\-the\-Middle attacks. You should definitely use a dedicated SMTP
account for Isso in that case.
.TP
.B to

.TP

connection attempt.

how many comments directly to the thread (prevent a simple
\fIwhile true; do curl ...; done\fP\&.
.TP
.B reply\-to\-self
allow commenters to reply to their own comments when they could still edit
the comment. After the editing timeframe is gone, commenters can reply to
their own comments anyways.
.sp
Do not forget to configure the \fI\%client\fP accordingly
.TP

performed on the provided value.
.sp
Do not forget to configure the \fI\%client\fP accordingly.

.TP
.B flags
\fI\%Misaka\-specific HTML rendering flags\fP, all html rendering flags
can be used here, separated by comma, either by their name or as \fBHTML_\fP\&.
Per Misaka\(aqs defaults, no flags are set.
.TP
.B allowed\-elements
Additional HTML tags to allow in the generated output, comma\-separated. By
default, only \fIa\fP, \fIblockquote\fP, \fIbr\fP, \fIcode\fP, \fIdel\fP, \fIem\fP, \fIh1\fP, \fIh2\fP,
\fIh3\fP, \fIh4\fP, \fIh5\fP, \fIh6\fP, \fIhr\fP, \fIins\fP, \fIli\fP, \fIol\fP, \fIp\fP, \fIpre\fP, \fIstrong\fP,
\fItable\fP, \fItbody\fP, \fItd\fP, \fIth\fP, \fIthead\fP and \fIul\fP are allowed.
.TP
.B allowed\-attributes
Additional HTML attributes (independent from elements) to allow in the
generated output, comma\-separated. By default, only \fIalign\fP and \fIhref\fP are
allowed.
.UNINDENT
.sp
To allow images in comments, you just need to add \fBallowed\-elements = img\fP and
\fBallowed\-attributes = src\fP\&.
.SH HASH

commenters but still be able to generate an identicon.

.B salt
A salt is used to protect against rainbow tables. Isso does not make use of
pepper (yet). The default value has been in use since the release of Isso
and generates the same identicons for same addresses across installations.
.TP
.B algorithm
Hash algorithm to use \-\- either from Python\(aqs \fIhashlib\fP or PBKDF2 (a
computational expensive hash function).
.sp
The actual identifier for PBKDF2 is \fIpbkdf2:1000:6:sha1\fP, which means 1000
iterations, 6 bytes to generate and SHA1 as pseudo\-random family used for
key strengthening.
Arguments have to be in that order, but can be reduced to \fIpbkdf2:4096\fP
for example to override the iterations only.
.UNINDENT
.SH RSS
.sp
Isso can provide an Atom feed for each comment thread. Users can use
them to subscribe to comments and be notified of changes. Atom feeds
are enabled as soon as there is a base URL defined in this section.

.B Timedelta
A human\-friendly representation of a time range: \fI1m\fP equals to 60
seconds. This works for years (y), weeks (w), days (d) and seconds (s),
e.g. \fI30s\fP equals 30 to seconds.
.sp
You can add different types: \fI1m30s\fP equals to 90 seconds, \fI3h45m12s\fP
equals to 3 hours, 45 minutes and 12 seconds (12512 seconds).
.UNINDENT
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
Isso also support configuration through some environment variables:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B ISSO_CORS_ORIGIN
By default, \fIisso\fP will use the \fIHost\fP or else the \fIReferrer\fP HTTP header
of the request to defines a CORS \fIAccess\-Control\-Allow\-Origin\fP HTTP header
in the response.
This environent variable allows you to define a broader fixed value,
in order for example to share a single Isso instance among serveral of your
subdomains : \fIISSO_CORS_ORIGIN=*.example.test\fP
