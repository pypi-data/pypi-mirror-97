        Create a new object of the class itkNeighborhoodConnectedImageFilterIUS4IUS4 and set the input and the parameters if some
        named or non-named arguments are passed to that method.

        New() tries to assign all the non named parameters to the input of the new objects - the
        first non named parameter in the first input, etc.

        The named parameters are used by calling the method with the same name prefixed by 'Set'.

        Ex:

          itkNeighborhoodConnectedImageFilterIUS4IUS4.New(reader, threshold=10)

        is (most of the time) equivalent to:

          obj = itkNeighborhoodConnectedImageFilterIUS4IUS4.New()
