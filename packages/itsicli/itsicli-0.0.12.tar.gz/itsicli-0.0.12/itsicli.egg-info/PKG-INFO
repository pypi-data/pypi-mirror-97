Description: # The ITSI Command Line Interface (CLI)
        
        ## Setup Virtualenv
        
        
        ```
        python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
        
        source /path/to/new/virtual/environment/bin/activate
        ```
        
        ## Install the Python package
        
        ```
        pip install --upgrade itsicli
        ```
        
        
        ## Using "itsi-content-pack"
        
        The `itsi-content-pack` command that is shipped with the Python package assists in creating and managing ITSI Content Packs.
        
        The general end-to-end workflow is as follows:
        1. Initialize a Content Pack workspace
        1. Create a Content Pack (or optionally import from an ITSI backup file)
        1. Continue to add, remove, or edit content from the Content Pack
        1. Add any supporting Splunk knowledge objects (lookups, transforms, props, etc.)
        1. Validate the Content Pack through the `validate` command 
        1. Submit the Content Pack to either:
            - Splunkbase (must first run the `build` command)
            - The ITSI Content Library via a pull request on Github
        
        
        ### An example of creating a Content Pack
        
        ### Initialize content pack
        Update PATH and PYTHON path to include `itsi-cli/bin` and `itsi-cli` folders
        ```
        export PYTHONPATH=<path to itsi-cli>
        export PATH=$PATH$:<path to itsi-cli/bin>
        ```
        
        Create a directory to hold content pack files. This folder will be referred to as `CP_BASE_DIR`
        ```
        mkdir DA-ITSI-CP-mycontentpack
        cd DA-ITSI-CP-mycontentpack
        ```
        
        Invoke **itsi-content-pack** with `init`
        ```
        itsi-content-pack init
        ```
        
        Follow the prompt to provide a content pack id and title. Please prefix id with `DA-ITSI-CP-`. Once complete, three directories will be created
        - itsi
        - default
        - appserver
        
        Each folder will contain some scaffolding files/directories. Please examine them and update as needed.
        
        
        ## Build the distribution archive
        
        Install the build dependencies:
        ```
        pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel
        ```
        
        ### Generate the Python package
        
        Run this command to generate the Python distribution archive:
        ```
        make
        ```
        
        ### Upload to the Python Package Index
        
        Install the dependencies required for uploading to the index:
        
        ```
        pip install --upgrade twine
        ```
        
        Upload to PyPI:
        
        ```
        make upload
        ```
