        ### jwtXploiter
        A tool to test security of JSON Web Tokens.
        Test a JWT against all known CVEs;
        - Tamper with the token payload: changes claims and subclaims values.
        - Exploit known vulnerable header claims (kid, jku, x5u)
        - Verify a token
        - Retrieve the public key of your target's ssl connection and try to use it in a key confusion attack with one option only
        - All JWAs supported
        - Generates a JWK and insert it in the token header
        - And much, much more!

        ### Who this tool is written for?
        
        + Web Application Penetration Tester / Bug Bounty Hunters
        
          - This tool has been written with the aim of become a key part of pentesters toolkit.
        
        + Devs who need to test the secuirty of JWTs used in their applications
        
        + CTF Players
        
        + Not For Students
        
          - Since this tool automates lot of stuff, without force the user to know what's happening under the hood, it won't
            help you to understand the vulnerabilities it exploits.
        
        ### To Know
        
        - For attacks that generates a jwks file, you could find it in the current working directory. Remeber to deletes such files
          in order to avoid conflicts.
        
        - For jku/x5u injection that needs to merge two urls (the server vulnerable url and your one), the HERE keyword is required.
        - For redirect attacks the keyword should replace the redirect url, e.g.
          - http://app.com/foo?redirect=bar&some=thing  -->  http://app.com/foo?redirect=HERE&some=thing
        - For jku/x5u injections via HTTP header injection attacks, the HERE keyword sould be appended to the vulnerable parameter,
          without replacing its value, e.g.
          - http://app.com/foo?param=value  -->  http://app.com/foo?param=valueHERE
        - Also, in such cases, be sure to pass the server url and your one as comma separated values.
        
        - '/.well-known/jwks.json' is automatically appended to your url in jku/x5u attacks. So make sure to place the jwks file under
          this path on your server.
        - If you don't want that happen, use the --manual option, but this option is compatible only with --jku-basic and --x5u-basic
          so, you will need to manually craft the url and pass it to those options, even for attacks that exploit Open Redirect or
          HTTP header injection.
        
        - Look at the wiki for a detailed documentation.
