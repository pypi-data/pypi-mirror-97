Description: # Konfsave
        
        Konfsave is a KDE config manager. That is, it allows you to save, back up, and easily switch between different KDE configurations.
        Each configuration is stored as a profile; the script allows you to save the current configuration as a named profile,
        and then load profiles by name. Of course, it's also possible to take these profiles somewhere else by just copying their folder.
        
        OK, I lied. Although this is supposed to be a KDE config manager, it can work for pretty much anything that's stored in your home directory. You still have to be on a UNIX-like system, however. Just change the paths in `config.ini` to suit your needs and use '--no-restart' to disable restarting the Plasma shell if you don't care about its configs.
        
        Inspired by https://github.com/Prayag2/konsave.
        
        ## Notable features
        
        - Storing the current configuration as a profile
        - Optionally following symlinks
        - Remembering which profile is active at the moment
        - Updating existing profiles
        - Switching between profiles
        - Listing and configuring paths to save (both files and directories are supported)
        - Per-profile configuration of additional paths to save or exclude by default
        - Specifying additional paths to include or exclude using command-line arguments
        - Archiving (exporting) and importing profiles
        
        ## Requirements
        
        Python 3.8+ is required.
        
        ## Installation & Usage
        
        The configuration file, `config.ini`, is stored in `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/konfsave`.  
        Usage instructions can be viewed with `konfsave --help`.
        
        There are 2 installation options:
        
        #### PyPI
        
        Konfsave is on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/konfsave/), which means that it can be installed with `pip`:  
        	`python -m pip install konfsave`  
        After this, you should be able to run Konfsave directly from the terminal. If not, try `python -m konfsave`.
        
        #### The crude way
        
        `__main__.py` can be run as is; just download the repository.
        You can also run `install.sh` which will copy files to `.config` and link `__main__.py` to `.local/bin/konfsave`.
        Unlike the PyPI method, this will not allow you to easily update the program.
        
        ## Future features
        
        Right now, this program is WIP. Although it's useful in its current state, more features are planned, such as storing profiles as Git repositories and printing human-friendly information about which files are saved and what they do.
