Natural Language Processing
###########################
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is one of the most important fields of research today. It has many applications such as chatbots, sentiment analysis, and document classification.

What We Do 
##########
LanGauge is a web application leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) to reduce the time spent analyzing medical research papers in an easy-to-use fashion. 

This free open-source platform helps researchers in fields such as drug discovery curate their data securely and scale the development of health solutions. An example application would be enhancing COVID-19 research using multiple NLP models on medical datasets.

We want to use the language processing models to “gauge” the usefulness of open-source medical datasets for researchers.
