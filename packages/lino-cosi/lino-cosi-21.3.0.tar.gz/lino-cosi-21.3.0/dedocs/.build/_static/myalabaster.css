The alabaster theme which became default in Sphinx 1.3 is very
beautiful, but how can I get the `previous | next | index` links that
used to be in the upper right corner?

Answer: 

- add the following line to your `.templates/layout.html`::

    {% set css_files = css_files + ["_static/myalabaster.css"] %}

  (after the first line, which should be ``{% extends "!layout.html" %}``)

- add this file to your .static directory
