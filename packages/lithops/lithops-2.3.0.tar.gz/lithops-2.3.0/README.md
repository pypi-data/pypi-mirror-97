Lithops is a Python multi-cloud distributed computing framework. It allows to run unmodified local python code at massive scale in the main
serverless computing platforms. Lithops delivers the userâ€™s code into the cloud without requiring knowledge of how it is deployed and run. Moreover, its multicloud-agnostic architecture ensures portability across cloud providers, overcoming vendor lock-in.

Lithops provides value for a great variety of uses cases like big data analytics and embarrassingly parallel jobs. It is specially suited for highly-parallel programs with little or no need for communication between processes, but it also supports parallel applications that need to share state among processes. Examples of applications that run with Lithops include Monte Carlo simulations, deep learning and machine learning processes, metabolomics computations, and geospatial analytics, to name a few.


## Quick Start

1. Install Lithops from the PyPi repository:

    ```bash
    $ pip install lithops
    ```

2. Test Lithops by simply running the next command:
  
   ```bash
   $ lithops test
   ```

## Move to the Cloud
Lithops provides an extensible backend architecture (compute, storage) that is designed to work with different Cloud providers and on-premise backends. In this sense, you can code in python and run it unmodified in IBM Cloud, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud and Alibaba Aliyun. Moreover, it provides support for some kubernetes serverless frameworks such as Knative.

- [Follow these instructions to configure your compute and storage backends](config/)

## High-level API

Lithops is shipped with 2 different high-level Compute APIs, and 2 high-level Storage APIs

    print(os.listdir(dirname))
    os.remove(filepath)
```

## Execution Modes

Lithops is shipped with 3 different modes of execution. The execution mode allows you to decide where and how the functions are executed.

<table>
<tr>
<th align="center">
<img width="441" height="1px">
<p> 
<small>
<a href="docs/mode_localhost.md">Localhost Mode</a>
</small>
</p>
</th>
<th align="center">
<img width="441" height="1px">
<p> 
<small>
<a href="docs/mode_serverless.md">Serverless Mode</a>
</small>
</p>
</th>
<th align="center">
<img width="441" height="1px">
<p> 
<small>
<a href="docs/mode_standalone.md">Standalone Mode</a>
</small>
</p>
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

This mode allows to run functions in your local machine, by using processes. This is the default mode of execution if no configuration is provided.

</td>
<td>

This mode allows to run functions by using publicly accessible Serverless compute services, such as IBM Cloud Functions, Amazon Lambda or Google Cloud Functions, among others. In this mode of execution, each function invocation equals to a parallel task running in the cloud in an isolated environment.

</td>

<td>

This mode allows to run functions by using one or multiple Virtual machines (VM), either in a private cluster or in the cloud. In each VM, functions run using parallel processes like in the Localhost mode.

</td>
</tr>
