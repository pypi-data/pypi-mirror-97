Lokrez
======

A smash.gg-aware local-results generator for Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.

Usage
-----

----
$> lokrez -t [your-smash.gg-auth-token] top8 [tournament-slug-or-id]
----

The resulting outputs will be in +tournament-slug.lkrz+ (text version) and
+tournament-slug.svg+ (image version).

Use the +--help+ option for further details.


Requirements
------------

=== Modules
- *appdirs* is needed to find the right emplacements for config, cache and data
  files according to the OS ;
- *jinja2* is needed for templating ;
- *requests* is needed for HTTP(s) requests ;
- *cairosvg* can be used for some rasterized exports (see corresponding
  section)

=== Templates
The *rebootlyonXXX* templates needs the *Impact* font (available by default on
Windows, install +ttf-mscorefonts-installer+ on Ubuntu or Debian).

The *rebootlyon2020* template also need the *Gobold Regular* font, available at
https://www.dafont.com/gobold.font (free for personnal use).

=== Exports
The default and preferred output format is *SVG*.

You can also export to *PNG*, *PDF* and *PS* by using the corresponding
extension in the filename supplied to +--outfile+. Those exports are based on
the *SVG* output.

To export in *PNG*, lokrez will first try to use *Inkscape* command line. If
that fails (inkscape is not installed, or lokrez can't find it in your PATH),
it will try to use the *cairosvg* module (which can create artefacts for some
SVG objects).

To export in *PDF* or *PS*, lokrez will try to use the *cairosvg* module.

=== Images
The SSBU characters images are not included (since this is both copyrighted
work and a lot of heavy bitmaps). The +init+ command is designed to download
them for you and rename them according to lokrez expectations. Use it with
+lokrez init ssbu+. Then you can go make yourself a cup of coffee or two,
because that's about 3G you're going to download.

By default, the images are 

For reference, the images names look like :

-----
{charactername}/chara_{formatnumber}_{charactername}_{skinnumber}.png
-----

where:
- +charactername+ is the character name (see <<_SSBU_charaappendix for valid names)
- +formatnumber+ indicates what kind of image it is
    * +0+ is a 128x128 head crop
    * +1+ is a 512x512 bust crop
    * +2+ is the stock icon
    * +3+ is a large bust crop
    * +4+ is the ingame portrait
    * +5+ is the full image
    * +6+ is the 512x256 eyes crop
    * +7+ is a ?x300 upper bust crop
- +skinnumber+ indicates the character skin (00 being the default)
