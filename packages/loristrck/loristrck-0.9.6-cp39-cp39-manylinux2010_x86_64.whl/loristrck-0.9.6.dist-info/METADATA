LORISTRCK: a basic wrapper around the partial-tracking library Loris

This is the simplest wrapper possible for the partial-tracking library Loris.
The source of the library is included as part of the project --there is no need
to install the library independently.

The main goal was as an analysis tool for the package `sndtrck`, which
implements an agnostic data structure to handle partial tracking information
