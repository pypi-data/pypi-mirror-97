This is a very short reference for the most used features of Markdown.
For more complete info, see [John Gruber's original spec](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and the [Github-flavored Markdown info page](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/).

Note, that no Lukeparser features are used herin.
If you know Markdown already, feel free to skip this list.
Every Section contains its output right below the code in a collapsed box.

So let's begin.


### About Markdown

Markdown is a way to format Text -- very easily.
So easy that you can just start to write.

Formatting is getting more interesting; how to emphasize Text, embedding Images or including Tables?

See the guide below, for the most common Markdown syntax.


## Headers

```
# This is an h1-tag
## This is an h2-tag
###### This is an h6-tag

Nicer Header H1
===============

Nicer Header H2
---------------
```
\Output[
# This is an h1-tag {section-contentlist=False}
## This is an h2-tag {section-contentlist=False}
###### This is an h6-tag {section-contentlist=False}


Nicer Header H1 {section-contentlist=False}
===============

Nicer Header H2 {section-contentlist=False}
---------------

## Paragraphs & New Lines

```
First Line.
As well in first Line. (This Line ends with two Spaces)  
Second Line.

New Paragraph.

---
This text is seperated by a horizontal line. Note the empty line above the three Hyphens, 
otherwise ”new Paragraph“ would be a Header.  
Instead, you can also use three or more Underscores `_` or Stars `*`.
