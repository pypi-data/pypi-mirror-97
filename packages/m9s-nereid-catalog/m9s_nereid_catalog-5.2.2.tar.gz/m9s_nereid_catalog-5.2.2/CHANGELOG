Version 3.4.2.0
===============

This release intrdouces Product Media model to store media
items on product and template. Also provide safe migration
from product.image_set.

Version 3.4.0.3
===============

* Removed all traces of the ProductImageSet model in favour of linking Static
  Files to Products/Templates as One2Many field.
* product_product_imageset table is migrated to nereid_static_file table if the
  former is present.

Version 3.2.1.0
===============

* Major Change: Removed product category from being a cataloging system.

  Product category was being used as one of the means to generate a menu
  and catalog hierarchy. Category in Tryton is more of an accounting and
  inventory management system (than a catalog organisation item). Hence
  Product Category functionality that was extended to make it function in
  the web store is removed.

  Alternative: Use nereid-catalog-tree which offers a node object which
  allows products to be classified under multiple nodes.
