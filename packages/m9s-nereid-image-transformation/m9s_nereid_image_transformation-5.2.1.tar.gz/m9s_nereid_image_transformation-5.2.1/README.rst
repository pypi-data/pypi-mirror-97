Nereid Image Transformation Module
##################################

This module works as a dynamic image resizing addon for the static file
functionality in Nereid.

How to use
----------

The module introduces a new URL handler to the static file module, which
takes a URL path in which transformation commands could be embedded to
dynamically resize, rotate (TODO) and do various other tranformations.

A note of warning
-----------------

Image manipulation is slow! Really Slow!

Hence, this module is designed to be used with a frontend cache. The
responses from the module by default has instructions for frontend caches
to store the file in cache for 86400 seconds (equivalent to a day).

It is also recommended to use X-Send-File configuration with Nereid and
your web server (apache, nginx) to speed up delivery of images.

Examples
--------

::

    {{ product.large_image.transform_command().thumbnail(120, 120).resize(100, 100) }}

Using the above in a template should result in the following URL:

::

    /en_US/static-file-transform/1/thumbnail,w_120,h_120,m_n/resize,w_100,h_100,m_n.png
