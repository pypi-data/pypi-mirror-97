This is a development version of a module for multifractal analyses in Python. It already includes a version of the Chhabra-Jensen method.

:warning: Please, use the following article for references of the Chhabra-Jensen function:

França, L.G.S., Miranda, J.G.V., Leite, M., Sharma, N.K., Walker, M.C., Lemieux, L. and Wang, Y., 2018. [Fractal and Multifractal Properties of Electrographic Recordings of Human Brain Activity: Towards its Use as a Signal Feature for Machine Learning in Clinical Applications](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2018.01767/). Frontiers in Physiology, 9, p.1767. DOI: 10.3389/fphys.2018.01767

The code was developed based on the method described in:

Chhabra, A. & Jensen, R., 1989. [Direct determination of the f(α) singularity spectrum](http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevA.40.5284). Physical Review Letters, 62(12), pp.1327–1330.
