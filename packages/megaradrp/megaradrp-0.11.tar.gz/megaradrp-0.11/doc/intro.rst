The MEGARA Pipeline can be used as an stand-alone application (referred as 
MEGARA Data Reduction Pipeline or MEGARA DRP) or 
integrated in the GTC Control System (MEGARA Data Factory Pipeline or MEGARA DFP).

For detailed reference documentation of the functions and
classes contained in the package, see the :ref:`reference`.
    

.. warning::

   This "User Guide" is still a work in progress; some of the material
   is not organized, and several aspects of the MEGARA Pipeline are not yet covered
   in sufficient detail.
