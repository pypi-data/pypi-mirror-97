Observing modes
===============

Observing modes are prescribed method of observing with MEGARA. 
Each observing mode is processed with one reduction recipe. In the following
we describe the observing modes and its corresponding recipe. The **Usage** field
describes if the mode is to be used in the telescope (*Online*, DFP Mode) or after 
the observation by the user (*Offline*, DRP Mode).

Observing modes are described in full detail elsewhere (document TEC/MEG/05)
