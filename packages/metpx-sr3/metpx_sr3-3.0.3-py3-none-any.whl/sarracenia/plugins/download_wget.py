  Example use of do_download option.

  Custom downloading method to work with the message_download on_message plugin.
  See that plugin for more detailed information.
  
  This downloader will be invoked when an unknown protocol scheme is specified as a URL (we use 'wget')
  the script replaces 'download' by 'http' in the protocol, and then spawns a wget binary to perform
  an efficient download. 

  note that because this involves a for exec to launch a binary, it would be best to only launch this sort
  of download for larger files. the message_download implements this threshold behaviour.

  Caveats:
     This downloader just uses the name that wget will set for a file on download,
     no options about local file naming are implemented.

  If you have python >= 3.5, replace 'subprocess.call' by subprocess.run, and the stout and stderr will do the right thing.
  for 'call' also need to change result == 0 to result.returncode == 0 .

  I didn't find a simple way to do the 'right thing' in < 3.5 API.
