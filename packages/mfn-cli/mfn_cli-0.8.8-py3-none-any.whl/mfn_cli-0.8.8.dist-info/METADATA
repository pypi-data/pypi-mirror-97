# KNIX MicroFunctions Command Line Interface (CLI)

The package provides the `mfn` command based on the [KNIX MicroFunctions SDK](https://github.com/knix-microfunctions/knix/tree/master/mfn_sdk/).

The latest version of the CLI can be obtained from [KNIX releases](https://github.com/knix-microfunctions/knix/releases/).
It's also hosted at PyPI and can be installed with the PyPA recommended tool for installing Python packages:
``` sh
pip3 install mfn_cli
```

## Using the cli

### mfn login

The login action is used to obtain a valid user token for all subsequent operations.
The token will be updated/stored in ~/.mfn/config.yaml

``` sh
mfn login [--url <url>] [--user <username>] [--password <password>]
```

``` none
$ mfn login --url https://knix.io --user test@example.com
Logging into https://knix.io as user test@example.com
Please enter the password: ************
$
```

## Commands

``` none
$ mfn -h
