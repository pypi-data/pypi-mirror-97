MLX90641 is a thermal camera (16x12 pixels) using Far InfraRed radiation from objects to measure the object temperature.  
https://www.melexis.com/mlx90641  
The python package "[mlx90641-driver](https://github.com/melexis-fir/mlx90641-driver-py)" driver interfaces the MLX90641 and aims to facilitate rapid prototyping.

This package provide the I2C low level routines.
It uses the I2C from the device tree of a single board computer(SBC).  

## Getting started

### Installation

```bash
pip install mlx90641-driver-devicetree
```

https://pypi.org/project/mlx90641-driver-devicetree  
https://pypistats.org/packages/mlx90641-driver-devicetree

__Note:__  
Make sure the user has access to `/dev/i2c-<x>`.  
And easy way to do this is by adding the user to the group `i2c`.

### Running the driver demo

* Connect the MLX90641 on the I2C bus of the SBC.  
* Open a terminal and run following command:  

```bash
mlx90641-dump-devicetree /dev/i2c-1
```

This program takes 1 optional argument.

```bash
mlx90641-dump-devicetree <communication-port>
```

Note: this dump command is not yet available!
