# Package alias for model-index

This is an alias for the [model-index](https://github.com/paperswithcode/model-index) library. 

This package `modelindex` that has `model-index` as a dependency, so the `model-index` is correctly installed no matter which one is used. However, to depend on specific versions we suggest using `model-index` directly.
