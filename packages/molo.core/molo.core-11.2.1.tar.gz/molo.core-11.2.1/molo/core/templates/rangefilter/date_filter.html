File: molo/core/templates/daterange_filter/filter.html

This file is empty because:

- The django-daterange-filter package is unmaintained and does not support
  newer versions of Django admin
- If this template does not exist Django raises an exception
- Removing the package completely is hard because we use it with our own
  custom templates in the Wagtail admin
