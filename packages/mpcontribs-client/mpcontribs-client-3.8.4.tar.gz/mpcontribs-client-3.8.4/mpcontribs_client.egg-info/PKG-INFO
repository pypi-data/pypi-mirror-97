        Small, dynamic python client library to connect to [MPContribs](https://docs.mpcontribs.org)
        APIs based on Yelp's [bravado](https://bravado.readthedocs.io).
        
        ```python
        from mpcontribs.client import Client
        client = Client()
        dir(client) # show available resources
        ```
        
        By default, the client connects to https://contribs-api.materialsproject.org and uses the environment variable
        `MPCONTRIBS_API_KEY` to set the API key. The key can alternatively be set explicitly via the
        `apikey` argument to the constructor. The `host` argument or the `MPCONTRIBS_API_HOST`
        environment variable can be set to connect to other MPContribs-style APIs:
        
        ```python
        client = Client(host='ml-api.materialsproject.org')
        ```
