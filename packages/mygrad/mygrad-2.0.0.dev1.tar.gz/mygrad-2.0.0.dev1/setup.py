DESCRIPTION = "A sleek auto-differentiation library that wraps numpy."
LONG_DESCRIPTION = """
mygrad is a simple, NumPy-centric autograd library. An autograd library enables
you to automatically compute derivatives of mathematical functions. This library is
designed to serve primarily as an education tool for learning about gradient-based
machine learning; it is easy to install, has a readable and easily customizable code base,
and provides a sleek interface that mimics NumPy. Furthermore, it leverages NumPy's
vectorization to achieve good performance despite the library's simplicity.

This is not meant to be a competitor to libraries like PyTorch (which mygrad most
closely resembles) or TensorFlow. Rather, it is meant to serve as a useful tool for
students who are learning about training neural networks using back propagation.
