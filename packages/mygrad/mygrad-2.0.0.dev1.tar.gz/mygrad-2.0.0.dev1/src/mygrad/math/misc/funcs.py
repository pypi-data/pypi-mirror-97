    This docstring was adapted from that of numpy.absolute [1]_

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ArrayLike
        Input array.

    out : Optional[Union[Tensor, ndarray]]
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
        a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
        a freshly-allocated tensor is returned.

    constant : Optional[bool]
        If ``True``, this tensor is treated as a constant, and thus does not
        facilitate back propagation (i.e. ``constant.grad`` will always return
        ``None``).

        Defaults to ``False`` for float-type data.
        Defaults to ``True`` for integer-type data.

        Integer-type tensors must be constant.

    where : Mask
        This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
        condition is True, the ``out`` tensor will be set to the ufunc result.
        Elsewhere, the ``out`` tensor will retain its original value.
        Note that if an uninitialized `out` tensor is created via the default
        ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
        remain uninitialized.

    dtype : Optional[DTypeLikeReals]
        The dtype of the resulting tensor.

    Returns
    -------
    absolute : Tensor
        An ndarray containing the absolute value of
        each element in `x`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ArrayLike

    out : Optional[Union[Tensor, ndarray]]
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have

    dtype : Optional[DTypeLikeReals]
        The dtype of the resulting tensor.

    Returns
    -------
    y : ndarray
        A tensor of the same shape as `x`, containing the positive
        square-root of each element in `x`. Negative-valued inputs
        produce nans.


    Notes
    -----
    *sqrt* has--consistent with common convention--as its branch cut the
    real "interval" [`-inf`, 0), and is continuous from above on it.
    A branch cut is a curve in the complex plane across which a given
    complex function fails to be continuous.
