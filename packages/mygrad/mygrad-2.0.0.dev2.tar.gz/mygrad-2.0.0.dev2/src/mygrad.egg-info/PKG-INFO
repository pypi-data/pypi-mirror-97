Description: 
        mygrad is a simple, NumPy-centric autograd library. An autograd library enables
        you to automatically compute derivatives of mathematical functions. This library is
        designed to serve primarily as an education tool for learning about gradient-based
        machine learning; it is easy to install, has a readable and easily customizable code base,
        and provides a sleek interface that mimics NumPy. Furthermore, it leverages NumPy's
        vectorization to achieve good performance despite the library's simplicity.
        
        This is not meant to be a competitor to libraries like PyTorch (which mygrad most
        closely resembles) or TensorFlow. Rather, it is meant to serve as a useful tool for
        students who are learning about training neural networks using back propagation.
