# Naive Tester

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/naive-tester.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/naive-tester)

A simple testing system based on files. You provide a name of a script
to be tested and a folder containing files with arguments and reference
outputs. The app runs the script with the arguments from a file and compares
its result with that from the corresponding reference output file.
The following naming convention is applied:
each set of arguments is stored in the '.in' file, while the corresponding
output in the '.out' file, i.e., 'test_0.in' and 'test_0.out'.
Each pair must have identical names except for extensions.

## Installation
The Naive Tester can be installed from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/naive-tester/):
~~~
$ pip install naive-tester
~~~
The tester supports Python 3.6 and above. It is recommended to use virtual
environments for installation.

## How to use
Assume you created a python script some_app.py and want to test it. Your app
takes a string as an argument and outputs the length of that string to the console.
The application call might look like this:
~~~
$ python some_app.py input_string
$ 12
~~~
The first step is to prepare the tests, in this case, is to create a bunch of files.
Those with the '.in' extension must contain script arguments, i.e., 'input_string'
from the example above, and those with '.out' extension containing expected output,
i.e., '12'. The latter will be used for comparison with the script's output.
In other words, each pair of the files represents one test case.
~~~
some_app/
|
├── tests
|   ├── test_0.in
|   ├── test_0.out
|   ├── test_1.in
|   ├── test_1.out
|   ...
└── some_app.py
~~~
After the preparation step, you can run all the tests with the following command:
~~~
$ tester some_app.py tests
~~~
If you want the output to be more verbose, use the ```-v``` option:
~~~
$ tester -v some_app.py tests
~~~

Example outputs will be like the following:
~~~
Successfully run the some_app.py.
Elapsed time: 0.15s
Run of the some_app.py failed.
Elapsed time: 0.07s
~~~
or (for verbose option):
~~~
Successfully run the some_app.py. With arguments ['12345678'] got the output of 8.
Elapsed time: 0.15s
Failed run of the some_app.py with ['12345678']. The output should be 8, but got 7.
Elapsed time: 0.06s
~~~
It is possible to save the output to a file using a standard Linux technique:
~~~
$ tester some_app.py tests > test_report.txt
~~~

If your script has more than just one argument, then to use it with the naive-tester, you should list the arguments on new lines in the '.in' files.
