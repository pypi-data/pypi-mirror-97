"""Tenancy model class definitions for nautobot-netbox-importer.

Note that in most cases the same model classes are used for both NetBox imports and Nautobot exports.
Because this plugin is meant *only* for NetBox-to-Nautobot migration, the create/update/delete methods on these classes
are for populating data into Nautobot only, never the reverse.
