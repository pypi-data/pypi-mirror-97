Description: ---
        
        # ndn-python-svs: State Vector Sync NDN Python library
        
        This python library implements the [State Vector Sync (SVS) protocol](https://named-data.github.io/StateVectorSync/) to synchronise states between multiple clients over NDN for distributed realtime applications.
        
        > This is an official implementation but considered 'experimental'. If there are any concerns or suggestions, please create [a new issue](https://github.com/justincpresley/ndn-python-svs/issues).
        
        ndn-python-svs uses the [python-ndn](https://github.com/named-data/python-ndn) library for it's implementation.

        ## Installation
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        * [python-ndn](https://python-ndn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/installation.html)
        
        * [nfd](https://named-data.net/doc/NFD/0.5.0/INSTALL.html)
        
        * [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) if downloading via python pip
        
        ### From Pip
        
        Download the python pip library [ndn-svs](https://pypi.org/project/ndn-svs/)
        
        ### From Source
        
        Clone or Fork the github repository [ndn-python-svs](https://github.com/justincpresley/ndn-python-svs)
        
        ### Examples
        
        To try out the chat demo application from source, follow the below steps.
        
        To create a chat client, simply run this in the home directory of the repo:
        ```
        python3 examples/chat_node.py -n NODE_NAME [-gp GROUP_PREFIX] [-h]
        ```
        You may create as many of these as possible and all clients will sync up using SVS.
        
        ### For All Usage
        
        Before you run the program, you must register the group prefix as multi-cast (even if you did not specifically define the group prefix):
        ```
        nfdc strategy set <group-prefix> /localhost/nfd/strategy/multicast/%FD%03
        ```
        The default (unless specified) **group prefix** is `/svs` for any build-in examples.
        
        [More on setting different strategies (like mutli-cast) for prefixes.](https://named-data.net/doc/NFD/current/manpages/nfdc-strategy.html)
