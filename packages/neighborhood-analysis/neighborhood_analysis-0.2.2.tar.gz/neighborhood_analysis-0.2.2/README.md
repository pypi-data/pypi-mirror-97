A python implementation of neighborhood analysis to profile cell-cell interaction using permutation test.

The parallelism has been implemented, so no need to do multi-processing yourself.

## Installation

Prebuild wheels for: Windwos, MacOS and Linux in 64bit, on Python version 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9

Requirements: Python >= 3.6

### From pypi

Normally, there should be a compatible wheel for your system. Just run:

```shell script
pip install neighborhood_analysis
```

If not, it will try to compile from a source, you need to install dependencies.

```shell script
# for windows
choco install rustup.install
# for Unix
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

pip install maturin

pip install neighborhood_analysis
```


### From source

Assume you have all the above dependencies, clone the repo, and then run:

```shell script
pip install .
```

## Usage

```python
import numpy as np
from neighborhood_analysis import CellCombs, get_point_neighbors, comb_bootstrap

# Get 10000 points, represent cell location
points = np.random.randint(0, 1000, (10000, 2))

# Assign each cell with a type
types_pool = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i']
types = np.random.choice(types_pool, 10000)

# Find cell neighbors at radius set at 10
# The points must be a list of tuple, otherwise it will raise TypeError
points = [(x, y) for (x, y) in points]
neighbors = get_point_neighbors(points, 10.0)

cc = CellCombs(types)
result = cc.bootstrap(types, neighbors)
# On my dual-core mac, this step takes 6~7 seconds.

X = [bool(i) for i in np.random.choice([True, False], 10000)]
Y = [bool(i) for i in np.random.choice([True, False], 10000)]
# The types must be a list of bool
z_score = comb_bootstrap(X, Y, neighbors, ignore_self=True)

```

      Constructor function

      Args:
          types: List[str]; All the type of cells in your research
          order: bool (False); If False, A->B and A<-B is the same.

      Bootstrap functions

      If method is 'pval', 1.0 means association, -1.0 means avoidance, 0.0 means insignificance.
      If method is 'zscore', results is the exact z-score value.

      Args:
          types: List[str]; The type of all the cells
          neighbors: List[List[int]]; eg. {1:[4,5], 2:[6,7]}, cell at index 1 has neighbor cells from index 4 and 5
          times: int (500); How many times to perform bootstrap
          pval: float (0.05); The threshold of p-value
          method: str ('pval'); 'pval' or 'zscore'
          ignore_self: bool (False); Whether to consider self as a neighbor

      Return:
          List of tuples, eg.(('a', 'b'), 1.0), the type a and type b has a relationship as association
