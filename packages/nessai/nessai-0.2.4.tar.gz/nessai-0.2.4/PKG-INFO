        # Nessai: Nested Sampling with Artificial Intelligence
        
        ``nessai`` (/ˈnɛsi/): Nested Sampling with Aritificial Intelligence
        
        ``nessai`` is a nested sampling algorithm for Bayesian Inference that incorporates normalisings flows. It is designed for applications where the Bayesian likelihood is computationally expensive.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ``nessai`` can be installed using ``pip``:
        
        ```console
        $ pip install nessai
        ```
        
        Installing via ``conda`` is not currently supported.
        
        ### PyTorch
        
        By default the version of PyTroch will not necessarily match the drivers on your system, to install a different version with the correct CUDA support see the PyTorch homepage for instructions: https://pytorch.org/.
        
        ### Adding Bilby
        
        This package requieres a fork of Bilby that includes the sampler, it can be installed by running (this requires pip):
        
        ```console
        $ pip install git+https://git.ligo.org/michael.williams/bilby.git@add-nessai-sampler#egg=bilby
        ```

        ## Acknowledgements
        
        The core nested sampling code, model design and code for computing the posterior in ``nessai`` was based on [`cpnest`](https://github.com/johnveitch/cpnest) with permission from the authors.
        
        The normalising flows implemented in ``nessai`` are all either directly imported from [`nflows`](https://github.com/bayesiains/nflows/tree/master/nflows) or heavily based on it.
        
        Other code snippets that draw on existing code reference the source in their corresponding doc-strings.
