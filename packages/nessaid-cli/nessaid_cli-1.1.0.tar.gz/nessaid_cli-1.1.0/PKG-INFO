Description: Nessaid CLI Framework
        
        This package implements a grammar specification and tools to compile the grammar and use it for driving CLIs.
        The CLI commands can be expressed in grammar with the support for custom tokens with suggestion and autocompletion.
        
        The grammar specification is parsed with PLY python package and the CLI objects are implemented on top of readline.
        The command loop is in async mode.
        
        Requirements
        
        asyncio: The commandline interpreter will be looping for console input in async mode
        
        ply: The lex-yacc like implementation of python. Will be used for parsing the grammar specification
        and tokenizing the line input
        
        pyreadline: For windows platforms. This is the readline implementation for windows platforms
        Enduser Utilities
        
        This package provides two classes for CLI building. NessaidCmd is intended to work
        like the standard Cmd class for simple CLI designs.
        It is a stripped down sub class of the more robest NessaidCli class.
        
        NessaidCmd: The basic Cmd like tool for end user.
        The CLI command handlers are defined as python methods with chosen prefix and the
        grammar definitions to drive them are expressed as the method docstring.
        
        NessaidCli: The generic base class for the CLI impelemntation.
        NessaidCmd is the stripped down version as an alternative for the default Cmd implementation
