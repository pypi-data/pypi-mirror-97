====================
Neuro SDK for Python
====================

A Python library for the Neuro Platform API.

Installation
============

The latest stable release is available on PyPI_. Either add ``neuro-sdk`` to your
``requirements.txt`` or install with pip::

   $ pip install -U neuro-sdk


Getting Started
===============


To start working with the Neuro Platform you need to login first.  The easiest way
to do it is the using of :term:`CLI` utility::

   $ neuro login

After the login a configuration file is created and it can be read later.

Use :func:`neuro_sdk.get` for initializing client instance from existing
configuration file::

  import neuro_sdk

  async with neuro_sdk.get() as client:
      jobs = [job async for job in client.jobs.list()]


The example above instantiates a ``client`` object in *async context manager* and
fetches a list of user's jobs.  On exit from ``async with`` statement the ``client``
object is closed and is not available for future calls.


See :ref:`usage` section for ideas how typical operations can be done with Neu.ro
platform. :ref:`reference` section contains the full API reference for all API classes,
functions etc.
