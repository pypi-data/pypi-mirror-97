Jobs
====

.. class:: Jobs

   Jobs subsystem, available as :attr:`Client.jobs`.

   User can start new job, terminate it, get status, list running jobs etc.

   .. comethod:: attach(id: str, *, \
                      stdin: bool = False, \
                      stdout: bool = False, \
                      stderr: bool = False, \
                 ) -> AsyncContextManager[StdStream]
      :async-with:

      Get access to standard input, output, and error streams of a running job.

      :param str id: job :attr:`~JobDescription.id` to use for command execution.

      :param bool stdin: ``True`` to attach stdin, default is ``False``.

      :param bool stdout: ``True`` to attach stdout, default is ``False``.

      :param bool stderr: ``True`` to attach stderr, default is ``False``.

      :return: Asynchronous context manager which can be used to access
               stdin/stdout/stderr, see :class:`StdStream` for details.

   .. comethod:: exec_create(id: str, cmd: List[str], *, \
                      tty: bool = False, \
                 ) -> str

      Create an exec session to run a command in a running job.

      :param str id: job :attr:`~JobDescription.id` to use for command execution.

      :param ~typing.Iterable[str] cmd: the command to execute, a sequence of
                                        :class:`str`, e.g. :class:`list` of strings.

      :param bool tty: ``True`` if :term:`tty` mode is requested, default is
                       ``False``.

      :return: Exec session id (:class:`str`).

   .. comethod:: exec_inspect(id: str, exec_id: str) -> ExecInspect

      Get exec session info.

      :param str id: job :attr:`~JobDescription.id`.

      :param str exec_id: exec id.

      :return: Exec session info, :class:`ExecInspect` instance.

   .. comethod:: exec_resize(id: str, exec_id: str, *, w: int, h: int) -> None

      Resize created TTY exec session.

      :param str id: job :attr:`~JobDescription.id`.

      :param str exec_id: exec id.

      :param int w: New screen width.

      :param int h: New screen height.

   .. comethod:: exec_start(id: str, exec_id: str) -> StdStream
      :async-with:

      Start an exec session, get access to session's stdin/stdout/stderr.

      :param str id: job :attr:`~JobDescription.id`.

      :param str exec_id: exec id.

      :return: Asynchronous context manager which can be used to access
               stdin/stdout/stderr, see :class:`StdStream` for details.

   .. comethod:: get_capacity() -> Mapping[str, int]

      Get counts of available job for current cluster for each available preset.

      The returned numbers reflect the remaining *cluster capacity*. In other words, it
      displays how many concurrent jobs for each preset can be started at the moment of
      the method call.

      The returned capacity is an approximation, the real value can differ if already
      running jobs are finished or another user starts own jobs at the same time.

      :return: A mapping of *preset_name* to *count*, where *count* is a number of
               concurrent jobs that can be executed using *preset_name*.

   .. comethod:: kill(id: str) -> None

      :param ~typing.Iterable[JobStatus] statuses: filter jobs by their statuses.

                                                   The parameter can be a set or list of
                                                   requested statuses,
                                                   e.g. ``{JobStatus.PENDIND,
                                                   JobStatus.RUNNING}`` can be used for
                                                   requesting only scheduled and running
                                                   job but skip finished and failed
                                                   ones.

                                                   Empty sequence means that jobs with
                                                   all statuses are returned (default
                                                   behavior). The list can be pretty
                                                   huge though.

      :param str name: Filter jobs by :attr:`~JobDescription.name` (exact match).

                       Empty string or ``None`` means that no filter is applied (default).

                                         Retrieves only jobs submitted with all tags from the specified list.

                                         Empty list means that no filter is applied (default).

      :param ~typing.Iterable[str] owners: filter jobs by their owners.

                                           The parameter can be a set or list of owner
                                           usernames (see :attr:`JobDescription.owner`
                                           for details).

                                           No owners filter is applied if the iterable
                                           is empty.

      :param ~datetime.datetime since: filter jobs by their creation date.

                                       Retrieves only jobs submitted after the specified date
                                       (including) if it is not ``None``.  If the parameter
                                       is a naive datetime object, it represents local time.

                                       ``None`` means that no filter is applied (default).

      :param ~datetime.datetime until: filter jobs by their creation date.

                                       Retrieves only jobs submitted before the specified date
                                       (including) if it is not ``None``.  If the parameter
                                       is a naive datetime object, it represents local time.

                                       ``None`` means that no filter is applied (default).

      :param bool reverse: iterate jobs in the reverse order.

                           If *reverse* is false (default) the jobs are iterated in
                           the order of their creation date, from earlier to later.
                           If *reverse* is true, they are iterated in the reverse order,
                           from later to earlier.

      :param int limit: limit the number of jobs.

                        ``None`` means no limit (default).

                 ) -> None
      :async-with:

      Forward local port to job, e.g.::

         async with client.jobs.port_forward(job_id, 8080, 80):

                                       job to stop instead of failing immediately
                                       because of total running jobs quota.
