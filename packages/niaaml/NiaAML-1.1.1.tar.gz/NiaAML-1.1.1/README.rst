NiaAML is an automated machine learning Python framework based on
nature-inspired algorithms for optimization. The name comes from the
automated machine learning method of the same name [1]. Its
goal is to efficiently compose the best possible classification pipeline
for the given task using components on the input. The components are
divided into three groups: feature seletion algorithms, feature
transformation algorithms and classifiers. The framework uses
nature-inspired algorithms for optimization to choose the best set of
components for the classification pipeline on the output and optimize
their parameters. We use `NiaPy framework <https://github.com/NiaOrg/NiaPy>`_ for the optimization process
which is a popular Python collection of nature-inspired algorithms. The
NiaAML framework is easy to use and customize or expand to suit your
needs.

The NiaAML framework allows you not only to run full pipeline optimization, but also separate implemented components such as classifiers, feature selection algorithms, etc. **It supports numerical and categorical features as well as missing values in datasets.**

- **Documentation:** https://niaaml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,
- **Tested OS:** Windows, Ubuntu, Fedora, Linux Mint and CentOS. **However, that does not mean it does not work on others.**

Installation
------------

pip
~~~

Install NiaAML with pip3:

.. code:: sh
