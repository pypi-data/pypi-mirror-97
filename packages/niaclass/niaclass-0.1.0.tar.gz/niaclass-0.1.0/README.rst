NiaClass
========

NiaClass is a framework for solving classification tasks using nature-inspired algorithms. The framework is written fully in Python. Its goal is to find the best possible set of classification rules for the input data using the `NiaPy framework <https://github.com/NiaOrg/NiaPy>`_, which is a popular Python collection of nature-inspired algorithms. The NiaClass classifier support numerical and categorical features.
