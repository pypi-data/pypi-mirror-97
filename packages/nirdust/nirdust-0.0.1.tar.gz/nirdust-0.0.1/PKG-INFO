        # Nirdust: Near Infrared Dust Finder
        
        Nirdust is a python package that uses K-band (2.2 micrometers) spectra to 
        measure the temperature of the dust heated by an Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) 
        accretion disk. 
        
        
        ## Motivation:
        
        K-band nuclear spectral continuum of Type 2 AGNs is often composed of two 
        components: the stellar population emission and a hot 800 - 1600 K dust component.
        Via subtraction of the stellar emission dust component fitting can be performed
        to map its presence and estimate its temperature.
        
        
        ## Features
        
        The package uses the modeling features of astropy to fit the hot dust component 
        of a AGN K-band spectrum with black body functions. And provide a class with
        methods for spectrum manipulation and normalized-blackbody-fitting. Because 
        Nirdust normalizes the spectra before fitting, is not necessary to 
        flux-calibrate spectra to use it. 
        
        Nirdust needs a minimum of two spectra to run: a nuclear one, where the dust 
        temperature will be determined, and an off-nuclear spectrum, where the emission 
        is considered to be purely stellar. The off-nuclear spectrum will be used by
        Nirdust to subtract the stellar emission from the nuclear spectrum. 
        
        
        
        
        Footnote: the hot dust component may or may not be present in your type 2 
        nuclei, do not get disappointed if Nirdust finds nothing.
        
        
        ## Requeriments
        
        You will need Python 3.8 or 3.9 to run Nirdust.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Clone this repo and then inside the local directory execute
        
        ``` python
        $ pip install -e .
        ```
