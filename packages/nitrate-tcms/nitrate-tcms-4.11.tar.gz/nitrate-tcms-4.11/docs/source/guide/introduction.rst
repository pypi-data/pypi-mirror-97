Introduction
============

"If it is not in the TCMS then we do not do it", and the converse: "If
we do it then it is in the TCMS".

The above motto has been the paradigm driving the development of the
TCMS. The development team has created a canonical source of information
about testing that is useful to both managers and QE Associates.

The TCMS provides:

-  Managers with a source of information on planning, cases and
   execution status.
-  Reproducibility across planning, cases and execution.
-  Audit traceability.
-  Increased productivity - Associates are able to identify and work on
   gaps in product coverage.
