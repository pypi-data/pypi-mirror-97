Highlights

Bugfixes

  runs (`PR#860`_).

* Fix incorrect URL encode during exporting test case runs to a CSV file
  (`#868`_).

* Fix wrong Python version in WSGIScriptAlias path (`#872`_)

JavaScript codebase cleanup
---------------------------

* No frontend feature depends on handlebars.js library now, it is removed from
  ``static/js/lib/``.

* JavaScript files ``hole.js``, ``validations.js``, ``detetmine_type.js`` and
  ``scriptaculous-controls.js.patch`` are not used anymore. They are deleted
  from the codebase.

* Use ``HTMLOrForeignElement.dataset`` to refactor and simplify the code that
  access ``data-*`` data in a test run page. Meanwhile, the ``data-param`` and
  ``data-params`` attributes are also renamed to more meaningful word
  accordingly.  For example to set a direct URL to change a test run's status,
  the data attribute name is ``data-action-url``.

Dependencies
------------

* Django 2.1 is dropped. (`#884`_)
* django-tinymce is upgraded to version `3.2.0`_.

Infrastructure improvements
---------------------------

* The latest image built based on the latest ``develop`` branch and the release
  image shares a same Dockerfile to be built. Hence, when you pull the latest
  image and run locally, you could have a same environment to try Nitrate.
  Please note that, the latest image does not aim to be used in production.

* The image size is reduced at least 30%.

* SECRET_KEY must be set explicitly now during deployment to your own
  environment. For the reason why this is required, please refer to Django's
  `documentation`_ about the ``SECRET_KEY``.

* A new entrypoint is added to the released container image. It is responsbile
  for initializing the instance on-demand by defining specific environment
  variables, for example, setting ``NITRATE_MIGRATE_DB`` to run database
  migration. For full detailed information, please refer to the `image registry`_.
  These variables are useful for the first run particularly, or make it easy
  to initialize to run in a non-production environment. Be careful of setting
  these variables, use them when you really know what you want to do and what
  will happen.

* Nitrate is able to be fully customized by mounting a container's volume and
  provide a custom settings Python module.

* New CI workflow is added to build RPM from latest ``develop`` branch, and
  then build and push latest image to Quay.io registry. (`PR#883`_)
