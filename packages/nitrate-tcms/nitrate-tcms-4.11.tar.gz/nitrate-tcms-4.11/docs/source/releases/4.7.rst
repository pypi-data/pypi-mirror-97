*Jun 27, 2020*

Release 4.7 includes many cleanup and code refactors of JavaScript codebase.

Django 3.0 is added to testenv and tests pass with this version. If you find
out any issue while running Nitrate with Django 3.0, please file issue.

``requirements.txt`` is removed as it is useless for installing dependent
packages. ``setup.py`` is organized well and it should be the place from where
to install requirements.

``jquery.shiftcheckbox`` and ``TableDnD`` are upgraded latest version.
