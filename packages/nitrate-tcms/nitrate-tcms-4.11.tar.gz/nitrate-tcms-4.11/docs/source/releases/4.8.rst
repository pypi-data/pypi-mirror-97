.. _4.8:

4.8
===

*Aug 30, 2020*

Python 3.8 is added to test environment and Nitrate should work with Python 3.8
well.

eslint-plugin-jsdoc is used to lint jsdocs in the JavaScript source code.

Lots of duplication of templates and JavaScript code of plans, cases and runs
search result are removed.

Deployment pipeline is added to Travis CI. From now on, when tag a new release
with a version, e.g. v4.8, the pipeline is triggered automatically to publish
Python source distribution package, build RPM in Copr, build a container image
and publish the image to Quay.io registry.

Bookmark application is removed entirely.
