.. _4.9:

4.9
===

*Dec 13, 2020*

Django 3.1 and Python 3.9 are added to test environment.

Fedora 31 buildroot is removed from CI and Copr, and no f31 package will be
available.

Fedora 33 buildroot is added to CI and Copr. Since this release, f33 package
will be built in `Fedora Copr`_.

The CI has been migrated to GitHub workflow. The whole CI related stuff are
simplified a lot. Now, the tox is the unified way to run tests from either local
development environment or the GitHub workflow.

Many bugs are fixed in the JavaScript codebase and the issue tracker, one big
issue is that it is unusable to file an issue from a case run detail pane.
