Description: 
        NMRPy is a Python 3 module for the processing and analysis of NMR spectra. The 
        functionality of NMRPy is structured to make the analysis of arrayed NMR 
        spectra more intuitive and is specifically targeted to the quantification of 
        reaction time-courses collected with NMR.
        
        NMRPy features a set of easy-to-use tools for:
        - easy loading of spectra from a variety of vendors,
        - bulk Fourier transform and phase correction of arrayed spectra,
        - peak selection (programmatically or using graphical widgets),
        - integration of peaks by deconvolution.
        
        NMRPy is developed by Johann Eicher and Johann Rohwer from the Laboratory for
        Molecular Systems Biology, Dept. of Biochemistry, Stellenbosch University, 
        South Africa.
