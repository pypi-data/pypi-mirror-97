features:
  - |
    The driver-lib now provides "get" methods for drivers to be able to
    query for objects by id. For example, get_loadbalancer(loadbalancer_id).
fixes:
  - Improved the driver_lib connecting to the driver-agent sockets.
  - Fixed a bug where the data model to_dict() may not recurse properly.
  - |
    Message receiving for the driver_lib will timeout after no response
    from the driver-agent.
