Description: # Octopulse Python Logger Package
        
        This is a Python library to setup clean structured logs, for local development, and production with Google Cloud Logging.
        
        This logger uses these external packages:
        * `google-cloud-logging`
        * `structlog`
        * `colorama`
        * `python-json-logger`
        
        ## Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the package.
        
        ```bash
        pip install octopulse-logger
        ```
        
        ## Setup
        
        To be able to sent logs to GCP, you need to provide authentication credentials to your application code by setting the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`
        Replace `[PATH]` with the file path of the JSON file that contains your service account key.
        ```commandline
        export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="[PATH]"
        ```
        
        Setup `_env` to `prod` to send logs to Google Cloud Logging
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        from octopulse_logger import logger_setup
        
        logger_setup.setup('logger_name', _env='test') # setup the logger
        ```
        
        Then you can start to log with [default logger](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html) or [structlog](https://www.structlog.org/en/stable/) :
        ```python
        import logging
        import structlog
        
        structlog.warning('Warning !', value_a=1)
        # or
        logging.error('An error occurred :(')
        
        ```
