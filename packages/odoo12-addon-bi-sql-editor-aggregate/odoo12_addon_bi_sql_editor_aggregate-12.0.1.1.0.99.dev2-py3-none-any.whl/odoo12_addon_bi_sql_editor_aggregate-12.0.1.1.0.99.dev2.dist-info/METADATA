To use this module, you need to adjust the aggregation on the custom fields
tab of the sql_view between validating the SQL

#. Go to 'Reporting' / 'Custom Reports'

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Can be integrated with bi_sql_editor, but breaks for existing sites.
* Would be good to integrate and remove need for additional install.
