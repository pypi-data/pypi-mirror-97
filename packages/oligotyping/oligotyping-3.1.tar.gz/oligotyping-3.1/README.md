Oligotyping
===============================================================================

Oligotyping is a novel supervised computational method to decompose very closely related 
taxa within microbial communities by utilizing very subtle nucleotide variation
among 16S Ribosomal RNA gene amplicon reads. It can reveal previously unobserved
ecological patterns, and hidden diversity concealed within environmental datasets.

With oligotyping, depending on the hyper-variable region, similarity threshold
between different types can be as low as 0.2%, more than a magnitude lower than
de facto 3% similarity threshold that is being used by OTU clustering methods.
