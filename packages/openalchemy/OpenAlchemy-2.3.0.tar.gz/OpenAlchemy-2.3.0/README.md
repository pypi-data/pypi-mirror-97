Translates an OpenAPI schema to SQLAlchemy models.

Supports OpenAPI 3.0 and 3.1.

Get started with the online editor that will guide you through using your
existing OpenAPI specification to define your database schema and offers
installing your models using `pip`:
[Online Editor](https://editor.openalchemy.io)

## Installation

```bash
python -m pip install OpenAlchemy
# To be able to load YAML file
python -m pip install OpenAlchemy[yaml]
```

## Example

For example, given the following OpenAPI specification:

```yaml
# ./examples/simple/example-spec.yml
openapi: "3.0.0"

info:
  title: Test Schema
  description: API to illustrate OpenAlchemy MVP.
  version: "0.1"

paths:
  /employee:
    get:
      summary: Used to retrieve all employees.
      responses:
        200:
          description: Return all employees from the database.
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  "$ref": "#/components/schemas/Employee"

components:
  schemas:
    Employee:
      description: Person that works for a company.
      type: object
      x-tablename: employee
      properties:
        id:
          type: integer
          description: Unique identifier for the employee.
          example: 0
          x-primary-key: true
          x-autoincrement: true
        name:
          type: string
          description: The name of the employee.
          example: David Andersson
          x-index: true
        division:
          type: string
          description: The part of the company the employee works in.
          example: Engineering
          x-index: true
        salary:
          type: number
          description: The amount of money the employee is paid.
          example: 1000000.00
      required:
        - id
        - name
        - division
```

The SQLALchemy models file then becomes:

```python
# models.py
from open_alchemy import init_yaml

init_yaml("./examples/simple/example-spec.yml")
```

The _Base_ and _Employee_ objects can be accessed:

```python
from open_alchemy.models import Base
from open_alchemy.models import Employee
```

With the _models_filename_ parameter a file is auto generated with type hints
for the SQLAlchemy models at the specified location, for example:
[type hinted models example](examples/simple/models_auto.py). This adds support
for IDE auto complete, for example for the model initialization:

![autocomplete init](examples/simple/models_autocomplete_init.png)

and for properties and methods available on an instance:

![autocomplete instance](examples/simple/models_autocomplete_instance.png)

An extensive set of examples with a range of features is here:

[examples for main features](examples)

An example API has been defined using connexion and Flask here:

[example connexion app](examples/app)

## Features

- initializing from JSON,
- initializing from YAML,
- build a package with the models for distribution, packaged as sdist or wheel,
- automatically generate a models file,
- `integer` (32 and 64 bit),
- `number` (float only),
- `boolean`,
- `string`,
- `password`,
- `byte`,
- `binary`,
- `date`,
- `date-time`,
- generic JSON data,
- `$ref` references for columns and models,
- remote `$ref` to other files on the same file system
  (_not supported on Windows_),
- remote `$ref` to other files at a URL,
- primary keys,
- auto incrementing,
- indexes,
- composite indexes,
- unique constraints,
- composite unique constraints,
- column nullability,
- foreign keys,
- default values for columns (both application and database side),
- many to one relationships,
- one to one relationships,
- one to many relationships,
- many to many relationships,
- many to many relationships with custom association tables,
- custom foreign keys for relationships,
- back references for relationships,
- `allOf` inheritance for columns and models,
- joined and single table inheritance,
- `from_str` model methods to construct from JSON string,
- `from_dict` model methods to construct from dictionaries,
- `to_str` model methods to convert instances to JSON string,
- `__str__` model methods to support the python `str` function,
- `__repr__` model methods to support the python `repr` function,
- `to_dict` model methods to convert instances to dictionaries,
- `readOnly` and `writeOnly` for influence the conversion to and from
  dictionaries,
- exposing created models under `open_alchemy.models` removing the need for
  `models.py` files,
- ability to mix in arbitrary classes into a model and
- can use the short `x-` prefix or a namespaced `x-open-alchemy-` prefix for
  extension properties.
