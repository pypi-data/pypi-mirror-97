        # Short Term Forcasting
        
        Short term forcasting is a Python package which is used to make short term forecasts for the energy sector. This repository contains all components for the machine learning pipeline required to make a forecast. In order to use the package you need to provide your own data storage and retrieval interface.
        
        # Installation
        
        ## Clone this repository:
        
        ```shell
        git clone git@github.com:alliander-opensource/short-term-forecasting.git
        ```
        
        ## Install dependencies
        
        ```shell
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        ## Install the openstf package
        
        ```shell
        pip install -e openstf
        ```
        
        ## Install own implementation of ktpbase
        
        The code in this repository expects a data storage and retrieval interface to be available through the `ktpbase` package. For more information about the implemented interface see TODO.
        
        # Usage
        
        To run a task use:
