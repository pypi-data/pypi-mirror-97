# This is a cross-platform list tracking distribution packages needed for
# install and tests
# see https://docs.openstack.org/infra/bindep/ for additional information.

# WARNING: please make sure any additional os-brick-specific dependency
# not already covered by other packages is also installed through devstack.
# os-brick installed through pip does not include this file, so
# the dependencies must be installed explicitly by changing
# the list of packages under files/*/os-brick in the devstack repository.
