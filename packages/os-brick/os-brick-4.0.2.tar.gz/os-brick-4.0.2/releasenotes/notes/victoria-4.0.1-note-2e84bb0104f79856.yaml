    The previous release contained a fix for
    `Bug #1865754 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1865754>`_ that
    required the presence of a heavyweight binary dependency solely to check
    the Ceph version.  This release reverts that change and substitutes a
    lightweight fix that does not impose that dependency.
