    Added an abstract OVSDB API in ``vif_plug_ovs``. All calls to OVS database
    will de done using this unique API.
    Command line implementation using ``ovs-vsctl`` was refactored as a
    backend for this abstract API.
    A new configuration variable, ``ovsdb_interface``, is added to select
    the interface for interacting with the OVS database.
