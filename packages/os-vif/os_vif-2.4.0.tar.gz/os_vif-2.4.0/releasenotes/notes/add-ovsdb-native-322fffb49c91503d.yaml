    Added native implementation of OVSDB API in ``vif_plug_ovs``. Both
    ``vsctl`` and ``native`` APIs could be selected by setting the
    configuration variable ``ovsdb_interface``.
    A new configuration variable, ``ovsdb_connection``, is added. This variable
    defines the connection string for the OVSDB backend.

    Changed default value of ``ovsdb_connection`` to "tcp:127.0.0.1:6640", to
    match the default value set in Neutron project. This connection string is
    needed by OVSDB native interface.
