    With this release, packagers of ``os-vif`` no longer need to create a
    dependency on ``brctl``. ``brctl`` is largely considered obsolete and has
    been replaced with iproute2 by default in many linux distributions.
    RHEL 8 will not ship ``brctl`` in its default repos. As part of a larger
    effort to remove usage of ``brctl`` from OpenStack ``os-vif`` has
    replaced its usage of ``brctl`` with ``pyroute2``. This does not introduce
    any new requirements as ``pyroute2`` is already a requirement.
