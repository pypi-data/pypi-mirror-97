fixes:
  - The use of contextlib and  with nested statements is deprecated.
    "with nested" statements are not python 3 compatible as with statement now directly
    support context managers. The use of contextlib and "with nested" statements has
    been removed from all unittests in favor of the @mock decorator syntax.
