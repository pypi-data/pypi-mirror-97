deprecations:
  - |
    The ``vsctl`` ovsdb driver is now deprecated for removal.
    The default ovsdb interface has now been updated to ``native``.
    This will use the ovs python binding instead of invoking
    the ``ovs-vsctl`` CLI. The ``native`` backend both outperforms
    the ``vsctl`` backend and require no elevated privileges to
    configure the ovsdb. This both improves security and
    reduces plug and unplug time.
upgrade:
  - |
    os-vif now uses the ``native`` ovsdb driver instead of ``vsctl`` driver.
    This reduces the number of privileged call that os-vif need to make
    and generally improves plugging performance. In future release the
    ``vsctl`` backend will be removed.
