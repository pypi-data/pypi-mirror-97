    As part of a `bug #1715317`_, MAC ageing was disabled for the intermediate
    bridge created as part of the hybrid plug mechanism. During the removal
    of ``brctl``, this behavior was inadvertently applied to all linux bridges
    created by os-vif including those used in the linuxbridge driver.
    As a result this can lead to packet flooding (see bug #1837252) when
    instances are migrated. This behavior has been reverted so that the
    default mac ageing is determined by the kernel and is not set when using
    the os-vif linux bridge plugin.
