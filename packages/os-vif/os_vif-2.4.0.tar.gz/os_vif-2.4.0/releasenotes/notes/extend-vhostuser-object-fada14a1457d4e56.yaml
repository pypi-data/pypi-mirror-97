features:
  - The vhostuser vif object has been modified to add the name of the
    vhostuser port. Previously to this modification, it was responsibility
    of ovs plugin to compute such name. This should not be necessary
    with this new field. Because of this new field the VIFVHostUser object
    version has been updated accordingly (to 1.1).
