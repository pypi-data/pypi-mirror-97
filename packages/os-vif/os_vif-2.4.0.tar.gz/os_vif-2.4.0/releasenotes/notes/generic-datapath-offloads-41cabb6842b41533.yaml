features:
  - A new set of attributes to port profiles has been introduced, namely
    ``Datapath Offload Types``, with ``DatapathOffloadRepresentor`` allowing
    os-vif to pass the required metadata for representors conforming to the
    kernel switchdev representor model.
deprecations:
  - The API for ``VIFPortProfileOVSRepresentor`` has been frozen pending
    deprecation of the class. Users should transition to setting the
    ``datapath_offload`` of ``VIFPortProfileOpenVSwitch`` to a
    ``DatapathOffloadRepresentor`` object to pass representor information.
