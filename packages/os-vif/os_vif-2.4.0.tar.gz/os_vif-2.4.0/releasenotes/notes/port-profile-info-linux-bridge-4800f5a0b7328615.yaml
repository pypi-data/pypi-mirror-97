    In ``vif_plug_linux_bridge``, a new field called
    ``supported_port_profiles`` is added to ``HostVIFInfo`` objects. This
    field is a list of ``HostPortProfileInfo`` objects describing the
    supported port profiles for each specific VIF type.
    Currently this field is only being used in ``vif_plug_ovs``.
