    In ``vif_plug_ovs``, a new field called ``supported_port_profiles`` is
    added to ``HostVIFInfo`` objects. This field is a list of
    ``HostPortProfileInfo`` objects describing the supported port profiles for
    each specific VIF type.
    Currently two port profiles are supported: ``VIFPortProfileOpenVSwitch``
    and ``VIFPortProfileOVSRepresentor``.
