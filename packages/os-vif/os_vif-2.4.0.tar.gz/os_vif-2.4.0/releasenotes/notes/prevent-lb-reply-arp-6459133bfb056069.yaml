    Prevent Linux Bridge from replying to ARP messages. It should reply only if
    the target IP address is a local address configured on the incoming
    interface and it should always use the best local address. See `The ARP
    flux problem <http://linux-ip.net/html/ether-arp.html#ether-arp-flux>`_ for
    more information.
