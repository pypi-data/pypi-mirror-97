    In 1.13.0 it was reported that bug #1734320 was partially resolved by
    change Iaf15fa7a678ec2624f7c12f634269c465fbad930. It has since emerged
    that that change introduced another bug due to an interaction with
    libvirt. It was understood that libvirt would not recreate the ovs port
    if it was present on the ovs bridge when spawning a vm however on
    inspection of the libvirt code this is not the case. In this release
    we have reverted the change to os-vif and libvirt will be the only
    entity to create the ovs port when vif_type is set to ovs and
    hybrid_plug is set to false in the neutron port binding details.
    Bug #1734320 is not expected to be present if hybrid_plug=true or
    vif_type vhost-user is used on linux. On windows if hybrid_plug is false
    on bug #1734320 is also not expected to be present. A new mitigation to
    bug #1734320 will be developed for the remaining case of
    hybrid_plug=false on linux.
