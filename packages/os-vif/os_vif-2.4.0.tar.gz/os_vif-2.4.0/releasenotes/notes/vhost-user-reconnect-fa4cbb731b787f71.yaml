  - vhost-user reconnect is a new feature of qemu that
    allows a vhost-user frontend(e.g. qemu) to reconnect
    to a vhost-user backend (e.g. ovs with dpdk) in the event
    that backend is restarted while the interface is in use.
    vhost-user reconnect leverages qemu vhost-user server mode
    with ovs-dpdk in client mode. This configuration requires
    ovs 2.6 with dpdk 16.07 and qemu 2.7 or newer to function.
    When qemu server mode is used with older qemu versions such
    as 2.5, vhost-user will still function with ovs 2.6 and
    dpdk 16.07, however, reconnect functionality will not be
    available.
