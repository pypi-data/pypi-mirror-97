    Add default config-dir paths if no --config-dir switches are given on the
    command line. This is similar to the default config-file handling
    oslo.config already supports.
    If no --config-dir switches are given, oslo.config searches now in a couple
    of directories (depending on the given project name) for config file
    snippets. Non-existing directories are simply skipped.
    The directories, if no project name is given, are:

    * ~/${prog}.conf.d/
    * /etc/${prog}.conf.d/

    Only the first directory is used if that is available.
    If a project is given, the directories searched is a bit more complicated.
    2 directories are searched, first search is for the project related dir:

    * ~/.${project}/${project}.conf.d/
    * ~/${project}.conf.d/
    * /etc/${project}/${project}.conf.d/
    * /etc/${project}.conf.d/

    Then for the program name related configs, the following directories are
    searched:

    * ~/.${project}/${prog}.conf.d/
    * ~/${prog}.conf.d/
    * /etc/${project}/${prog}.conf.d/
    * /etc/${prog}.conf.d/

other:
  - Adding some default config-dirs makes it possible to use config dir snippets
    also in wsgi environments (like Apache) where it is not easily possible to
    pass command line parameters to a wsgi app.
upgrade:
  - Similar to 'default_config_files', 'default_config_dirs' is no longer an
    allowed config key. If that key is used, a ValueError() will be raised.
