    A validator for config files is now available. When run against a config
    file, it will report an error for any options present that aren't defined
    in the service and will report a warning for any deprecated options in
    the file. In order to discover the available options for a service, it
    can either use the sample config generator configuration file or a
    machine-readable sample config generated elsewhere.
