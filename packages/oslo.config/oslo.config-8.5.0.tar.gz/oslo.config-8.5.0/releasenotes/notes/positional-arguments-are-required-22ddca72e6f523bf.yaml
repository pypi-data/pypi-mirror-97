upgrade:
  - |
    Positional options are now required by default, to match argparse's default
    behavior. To revert this behavior (and maintain optional positional
    arguments), you need to explicitly specify ``positional=True,
    required=False`` as part of the options definition.
fixes:
  - |
    On the command line, oslo.config now returns command usage information from
    argparse (instead of dumping a backtrace) when required arguments are
    missing.
