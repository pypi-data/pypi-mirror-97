features:
  - |
    oslo.config now supports the fatal-deprecations option from oslo.log.  This
    behavior is only enabled if oslo.log is installed, but oslo.log is still
    not a hard requirement to avoid a circular dependency.
upgrade:
  - |
    Because support for fatal-deprecations was added in this release, users who
    have fatal-deprecations enabled and have deprecated config opts in use
    (which previously was not a problem because oslo.config didn't respect the
    fatal-deprecations option) will need to resolve that before upgrading or
    services may fail to start.
