    The ``oslo-config-validator`` tool now has a new option,
    ``--exclude-group``, that allows deployers to ignore certain groups that
    might not appear in the sample config data, perhaps because the name of
    the group depends on other configuration values. This way the validator
    can still be used on the known groups.
