features:
  - |
    ``DeprecatedRule`` now accepts two new parameters: ``deprecated_reason``
    and ``deprecated_since``. These should be used in place of the equivalent
    parameters on the rule that is replacing this rule in order to avoid
    confusion.
upgrade:
  - |
    Users with a ``RuleDefault`` or ``DocumentedRuleDefault`` that have
    configured a ``deprecated_rule`` should move the ``deprecated_reason``
    and ``deprecated_since`` parameters to this ``DeprecatedRule``.
