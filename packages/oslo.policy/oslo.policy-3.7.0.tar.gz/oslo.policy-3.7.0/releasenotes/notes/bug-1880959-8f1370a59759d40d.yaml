    [`bug 1880959 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1880959>`_]
    The behavior of policy file reloading from policy directories was fixed.
    Previously the rules from policy files located in the directories
    specified in the ``policy_dirs`` option were not reapplied after the rules
    from the primary policy file have been reapplied due to a change.
