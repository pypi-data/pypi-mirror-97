    ``policy_file`` support for JSON formatted file is deprecated. Use
    YAML formatted file which will be default in future.
    Use `oslopolicy-convert-json-to-yaml <https://docs.openstack.org/oslo.policy/latest/cli/oslopolicy-convert-json-to-yaml.html>`_
    tool to convert the existing JSON to YAML formatted policy file in
    backward compatible way.

    JSON format support and ``--format`` option in ``oslopolicy-sample-generator``
    and ``oslopolicy-policy-upgrade`` tools are also deprecated. In future
    release, ``--format`` option will be removed.
