    A new configuration option ``enforce_new_defaults`` has been
    added to the ``[oslo_policy]`` group to control whether or not to
    use the old deprecated defaults. If ``True``, the old deprecated
    defaults are not going to be evaluated which means if any existing
    token is allowed for old defaults but disallowed for new defaults
    it will be disallowed. It is encouraged to enable this flag along
    with the ``enforce_scope`` flag so that you can get the benefits of
    new defaults and ``scope_type`` together. This way operators can switch
    to new defaults without overwriting the rules in the policy file.
