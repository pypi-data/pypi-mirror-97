    ovsdbapp must get granted access to ovsdb by adding a new Manager via ovs-vsctl
    command. The command must be executed with root privileges. An example of how to
    create a new manager for localhost on port 6640 is as follows:

    .. code-block:: console

       sudo ovs-vsctl --id=@manager \
           -- create Manager target=\"ptcp:6640:127.0.0.1\" \\
           -- add Open_vSwitch . manager_options @manager
