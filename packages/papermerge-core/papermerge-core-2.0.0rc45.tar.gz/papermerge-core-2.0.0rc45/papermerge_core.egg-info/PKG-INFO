        What is Papermerge?
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Papermerge is an open source document management system (DMS) primarily
        designed for archiving and retrieving your digital documents. Instead of
        having piles of paper documents all over your desk, office or drawers - you
        can quickly scan them and configure your scanner to directly upload to
        Papermerge DMS. Papermerge DMS on its turn will extract text data from the
        scanned documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology the
        index it and make it searchable. You will be able to quickly find any
        (scanned!) document using full text search capabilities.
        
        Papermerge is perfect tool to manage PDF, JPEG, TIFF and PNG formats.
