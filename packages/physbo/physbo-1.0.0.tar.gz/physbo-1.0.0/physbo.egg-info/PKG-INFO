Description: # optimization tools for PHYsics based on Bayesian Optimization ( PHYSBO )
        
        Bayesian optimization has been proven as an effective tool in accelerating scientific discovery.
        A standard implementation (e.g., scikit-learn), however, can accommodate only small training data.
        PHYSBO is highly scalable due to an efficient protocol that employs Thompson sampling, random feature maps, one-rank Cholesky update and automatic hyperparameter tuning. Technical features are described in [COMBO's document](https://github.com/tsudalab/combo/blob/master/docs/combo_document.pdf).
        PHYSBO was developed based on [COMBO](https://github.com/tsudalab/combo) for academic use.

        ## Required Packages
        
        - Python >= 3.6
        - numpy
        - scipy
        
        ## Install
        
        - From PyPI (recommended)
        
        ```bash
        pip3 install physbo
        ```
        
        - From source (for developers)
            1. Update pip (>= 19.0)
        
                ```bash
                pip3 install -U pip
                ```
        
            1. Download or clone the github repository
        
                ```
                git clone https://github.com/issp-center-dev/PHYSBO
                ```
        
            1. Install via pip
                ``` bash
                # ./PHYSBO is the root directory of PHYSBO
                # pip install options such as --user are avaiable
        
                pip3 install ./PHYSBO
                ```
        
            1. Note: Do not `import physbo` at the root directory of the repository because `import physbo` does not try to import the installed PHYSBO but one in the repository, which includes Cython codes not compiled.
        
        ## Uninstall
        
        ```bash
        pip3 uninstall physbo
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ['examples/simple.py'](https://github.com/issp-center-dev/PHYSBO/examples/simple.py) is a simple example.
