    Contains credentials implementation.

    Credentials â€“ passwords, logins,
    application keys, secrets. This information is usually linked with connection parameters.
    Connection parameters separate from authentication, because auth is saved as a secret,
    and stored separately from configuration parameters (host name, ip addresses).
    They need added security and protection, so they were separated.

    Credential parameters include various credentials.

    Interfaces and abstract classes for credential stores, which can save or retrieve various credential parameters.
