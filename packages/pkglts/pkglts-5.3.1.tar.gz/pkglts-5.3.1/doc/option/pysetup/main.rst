pysetup
=======

Add a 'setup.py' to your package to make it compliant with setuptools_. This
will allow an easy distribution of your package. Since this option requires most
basic options, it's a good proxy to add to a newly created package to avoid
multiple 'manage add opt' commands.

Quick setup::

    (dvlpt)$ pmg add pysetup
    (dvlpt)$ pmg rg

Requirements files
------------------

Requirements for your projects are stored in your config in order to generate
two requirements files:

    - "requirements.txt" that contains all the requirements to use your package,
      play the examples, run the tests and compile the documentation.
    - "requirements_minimal.txt" that contains the bare minimal requirements to
      use your package. Think of it as the minimal requirements that will be used
      on a production server for example.

To help you keep track of your dependencies, you can use the :doc:`reqs` tool
provided with this option.
