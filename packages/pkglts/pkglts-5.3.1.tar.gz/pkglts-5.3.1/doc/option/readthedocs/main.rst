time to use the ReadTheDocs_ web service to perform this task automatically and
expose your documentation to the rest of the world.

service that will automatically compile and store your documentation. You still
need to perform the registration by hand. Look at :doc:`readthedocs_tutorial` for
a step by step guide::

    (dvlpt)$ pmg rg
