Description: # Plover Run Shell
        
        Command plugin for [Plover](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover) to run an arbitrary shell command.
        
        The package is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/user202729/plover_run_shell).
        
        ## Usage
        
        In order to use this plugin in [Plover](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover) you need to create a dictionary entry of the form:
        
        ``` json
        {
            "example_stroke": "{PLOVER:SHELL:command}"
        }
        ```
        
        Note:
        
        * The command might be executed synchronously (so you can use `&` on Linux or `start` on Windows
        if you don't want Plover to freeze, in case the called process is long-running).
        * (on UNIX systems) The command may be executed by the `sh` shell.
        If you want to use another shell, you can call that shell explicitly: `bash -c "command"`.
