## Install

This game is built with [Python][], which has [installation instructions here][python-installation].

The game can be downloaded with `pip`:

```sh
pip install --user -U "git+https://github.com/2ndBillingCycle/pokemon_yeet"
```

### Installation error

If `pip` returns an error like the following:

```
...
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/tmp/pip-req-build-h6qzslht/setup.py'

----------------------------------------

_note: running `pokemon` will create a directory called `pokemon/` to store information about Pokémon_

## Development

This repository can be downloaded with [`git`][] ([a mastermndio video about `git`](https://youtu.be/4AmqVslOw58)). Once that's done, [create a virtual environment in the same directory][python-venv]:

```sh
python -m venv venv
```

_note: depending on how [Python][] was installed, `python` may be `python3`, and `venv` may need to be downloaded separately (e.g. as `python3-venv`)_

This creates a directory called `venv` in the current directory. Then, activate the virtual environment. On Linux, this looks like:

```sh
. venv/bin/activate
```

Make sure `pip` inside the virtual environment is up to date:

```sh
pip install --upgrade pip
```

Then, the game can be installed in the virtual environment:

```sh
pip install ./
```

And you're ready to go! Change some files, re-install, and run again!

The installation is managed by [Flit][].
