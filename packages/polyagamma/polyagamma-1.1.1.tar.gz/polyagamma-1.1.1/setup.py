This requires an installation of [poetry][2]\nand the following shell commands:\n```shell\n$ git clone https://github.com/zoj613/polya-gamma.git\n$ cd polya-gamma/\n$ poetry install\n# add package to python\'s path\n$ export PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PYTHONPATH \n```\n\n## Example\n\n### Python\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom polyagamma import polyagamma\n\n# generate a PG(1, 0) sample\no = polyagamma()\n\n# Get a 5 by 10 array of PG(1, 2) variates.\no = polyagamma(z=2, size=(5, 10))\n\n# Pass sequences as input. Numpy\'s broadcasting rules apply here.\nh = [[1.5, 2, 0.75, 4, 5],\n     [9.5, 8, 7, 6, 0.9]]\no = polyagamma(h, -2.5)\n\n# Pass an output array\nout = np.empty(5)\npolyagamma(out=out)\nprint(out)\n\n# one can choose a sampling method from {devroye, alternate, gamma, saddle}.\n# If not given, the default behaviour is a hybrid sampler that picks a method\n# based on the parameter values.\no = polyagamma(method="saddle")\n\n# one can also use an existing instance of `numpy.random.Generator` as a parameter.\n# This is useful to reproduce samples generated via a given seed.\nrng = np.random.default_rng(12345)\no = polyagamma(random_state=rng)\n\n# If one is using a `numpy.random.RandomState` instance instead of the `Generator`\n# class, the object\'s underlying bitgenerator can be passed as the value of random_state\nbit_gen = np.random.RandomState(12345)._bit_generator\no = polyagamma(random_state=bit_gen)\n\n# When passing a large input array for the shape parameter `h`, parameter value\n# validation checks can be disabled to avoid some overhead, which may boost performance.\nlarge_h = np.ones(1000000)\no = polyagamma(large_h, disable_checks=True)\n```\n### C\nFor an example of how to use `polyagamma` in a C program, see [here][1].\n\n\n## Benchmarks\n\nBelow are runtime plots of 20000 samples generated for various values of `h` \nand `z`, using each method. We restrict `h` to integer values to accomodate the \n`devroye` method, which cannot be used for non-integer `h`. The version of the\npackage used to generate them is `v1.1.1`.\n\n![](./scripts/perf_methods_0.0.svg) | ![](./scripts/perf_methods_2.5.svg)\n| --- | --- |\n\n![](./scripts/perf_methods_5.0.svg) | ![](./scripts/perf_methods_10.0.svg)\n| --- | --- |\n\nGenerally:\n- The `gamma` method is slowest and should be avoided in cases where speed is paramount.\n- For `h > 25`, the `saddle` method is the fastest for any value of `z`.\n- For `0 <= z <= 2` and integer `h < 15`, the `devroye` method should be preferred.\n- For `z > 2` and integer/non-integer `h <= 25`, the `alternate` method is the most efficient.\n- For `h > 50` (or any value large enough), the normal approximation to the distribution is \nfastest (not reported in the above plot but it is around 10 times faster than the `saddle` \nmethod and also equally accurate).\n\nTherefore, we devise a "hybrid/default" sampler that picks a sampler based on the above guidelines.\n\nWe also benchmark the hybrid sampler runtime with the sampler found in the `pypolyagamma` \npackage (version `1.2.3`). The version of NumPy we use is `1.19.0`. We use the `pgdrawv`\nfunction which takes arrays as input. Below are runtime plots of 20000 samples for each \nvalue of `h` and `z`. Values of `h` range from 0.1 to 60, while `z` is set to 0, 2.5, 5, and 10.\n![](./scripts/perf_samplers_0.0.svg) | ![](./scripts/perf_samplers_2.5.svg)\n| --- | --- |\n\n![](./scripts/perf_samplers_5.0.svg) | ![](./scripts/perf_samplers_10.0.svg)\n| --- | --- |\n\nIt can be seen that when generating many samples at once for any given combination of \nparameters, `polyagamma` outperforms the `pypolyagamma` package. The exception is when \nvery small (e.g `h < 1`). Although not shown here, for values of `h` larger than 50, we use the normal approximation method. It is also worth noting that the `pypolygamma` package is on average faster than ours at \ngenerating exactly one sample from the distribution. This is mainly due to the \noverhead introduced by creating the bitgenerator + acquiring/releasing the thread lock + \ndoing parameter validation checks at every call to the function. This overhead can \nsomewhat be mitigated by passing in a random generator instance at every call to \nthe `polyagamma` function. For example, on an `iPython` session:\n```ipynb\nIn [4]: %timeit polyagamma()\n83.2 µs ± 1.02 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)\n\nIn [5]: %timeit polyagamma(random_state=rng)\n2.68 µs ± 29.7 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)\n\nIn [6]: %timeit polyagamma(random_state=rng, disable_checks=True)\n2.58 µs ± 22.3 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)\n```\n\nTo generate the above plots locally, run `python scripts/benchmark.py --size=<some size> --z=<z value>`.\nNote that the runtimes may differ  than the ones reported here, depending on the machine this script \nis ran on.\n\n\n## Density Plots\nBelow are density plots of the `PG(h, 0)` distribution using each of the available\nmethods. A plot generated using the `pypolyagamma` package is used for comparison.\n\n<p align="center">\n    <img src="./scripts/densities.svg">\n</p>\n\n\n## Contributing\nAll contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are welcome.\n\nTo submit a PR, follow the steps below:\n1) Fork the repo.\n2) Setup the dev environment with `poetry install`.
