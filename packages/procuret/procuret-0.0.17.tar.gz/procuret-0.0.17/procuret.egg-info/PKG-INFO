Description: # Procuret Python
        
        A Python library for interfacing with Procuret API.
        [Procuret](https://procuret.com) is a
        business - to - business payment platform that allows customers to pay
        for purchases over time, while the supplier is paid upfront.

        ## Installation
        
        Procuret Python may be [installed via PIP](https://pypi.org/project/procuret):
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install procuret
        ```
        
        To update Procuret Python to the latest version, use `pip --upgrade`:
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install --upgrade procuret
        ```
        
        ## Documentation
        
        Procuret Python offers a library of classes that map to services provided
        by the Procuret API.
        
        ### `Session`
        
        Sessions are the means of authenticating requests to the Procuret API. All
        requests to Procuret API, save for those creating Sessions themselves, require
        a Session.
        
        In Procuret Python, the `Session` class will handle all authentication for you.
        For example, it will compute the SHA256 signature that must be included
        in your HTTP headers.
        
        #### Properties
        
        - `.session_id: int` - A 63-bit positive integer uniquely identifying this
        `Session`. `Session` will include this number in requests to Procuret API, so
        that Procuret API can identify you.
        - `.api_key` - A 192-bit random number encoded in urlsafe base64 and generated
        in a cryptographically secure manner. `Session` will use this key to sign your
        requests to Procuret API using the SHA256 algorithm.
        
        #### Methods
        
        ##### `.create_with_email(...) -> Session`
        
        Use `.create_with_email()` to create a new `Session`. This is analogous to
        "logging in" to the Procuret API.
        
        ###### Parameters
        
        1. `email: str` - Your account email
        2. `plaintext_secret: str` - Your plaintext passphrase
        3. `perspective: Perspective` - an instance of `Perspective`
        
        ###### Example Usage
        
        ```python
        session = Session.create_with_email(
            email='me@somedomain.com',
            plaintext_secret='excellent passphrase',
            perspective=Perspective.SUPPLIER
        )
        ```
        
        ### `InstalmentLink`
        
        `InstalmentLink` facilitates the creation of customised links to the Procuret
        Instalment Product (PIP). PIP allows a customer Business to pay for a purchase
        over time, while you the Supplier are paid upfront.
        
        When you create an `InstalmentLink`, you can ask Procuret to send an email
        to the customer Business on your behalf.
        
        #### Properties
        
        - `.invitee_email: str` - The email address you associated with the link
        - `.invoice_amount: Decimal` - The invoice amount presented by the link
        - `.invoice_identifier: str` - The invoice ID presented by the link
        - `.url: str` - The URL of the link
        
        #### Methods
        
        ##### `.create(...) -> InstalmentLink`
        
        ###### Parameters
        
        1. `supplier: Union[int, EntityHeadline]` - Either the unique integer
        identifier of your Supplier entity in Procuret, or an instead of
        `EntityHeadline` describing your Supplier entity.
        2. `invoice_amount: Decimal` - The amount that you wish to charge the customer,
        in Australian dollars.
        3. `invoice_email: str` - The email address you wish to associate with this
        link.
        4. `invoice_identifier: str` - Your own identifier for the invoice. For
        example, you might use an invoice number from your accounting system.
        5. `communication: CommunicationOption` - An instance of `CommunicationOption`,
        which will tell Procuret API what you want it to do with the supplied email
        address.
        6. `session: Session` - An instance of `Session`, which will be used to
        authenticate your request.
        
        ###### Example usage
        
        ```python
        # First we get a Session. In this case we authenticate with email and
        # passphrase. In a real integration, you might store the Session elsehwhere.
        session = Session.create_with_email(
            email=email,
            plaintext_secret=secret,
            perspective=Perspective.SUPPLIER
        )
        
        # Now we use the Session in an InstalmentLink.create() call, along with
        # the parameters describing the link. By supplying
        # CommunicationOption.EMAIL_CUSTOMER, we tell Procuret that we would like
        # Procuret to send an email to the customer on our behalf inviting them
        # to pay using the link.
        link = InstalmentLink.create(
            supplier=supplier_id,
            invoice_amount=Decimal('422.42'),
            invitee_email='someone@great-domain.org',
            invoice_identifier='T 055',
            communication=CommunicationOption.EMAIL_CUSTOMER,
            session=session
        )
        ```
        
        ### `Perspective`
        
        Perspective is an enumeration of possible angles from which a client
        can engage with Procuret. If you wish to use Procuret services from
        the perspective of a Supplier, you will create a `Session` with the
        `Perspective.SUPPLIER` case.
        
        #### Cases
        
        - `.SUPPLIER`
        - `.BUSINESS`
        
        ### `CommunicationOption`
        
        An enumeration of instructions you can send Procuret in some contexts, to
        tell it how you wish for it to contact (or not contact) the a customer.
        
        #### Cases
        
        - `.EMAIL_CUSTOMER` - Procuret will contact the customer by email
        - `.DO_NOT_CONTACT_CUSTOMER` - Procuret will not try to contact the customer
