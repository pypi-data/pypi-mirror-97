        # Project Alice CLI
        
        This is a Project Alice command line tool.
        
        It simplifies to the maximum the installation and maintenance of Project Alice.
        
        It is not meant to be installed on the device that runs/will run Alice, but on your main computer.
        
        It handles connecting to network discoverable devices through SSH and generates RSA keys for a passwordless connection.
        
        Although it's a command line tool, made possible thanks to the awesome "Click" package, it is using the wonderful "PyInquirer" package to offer an interactive menu for people not used or wanting to type commands.
