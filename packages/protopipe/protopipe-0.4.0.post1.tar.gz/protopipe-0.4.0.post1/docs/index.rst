Welcome to protopipe's documentation!
=====================================

`Protopipe` is a pipeline prototype for the `Cherenkov Telescope Array <https://www.cta-observatory.org/>`__
(CTA) based on the `ctapipe <https://cta-observatory.github.io/ctapipe>`__ library.
The package has been developed and tested in the department of astrophysics at
`CEA-Saclay/IRFU <http://irfu.cea.fr/dap/en/index.php>`__,
but since Sep 23, 2019 is also open for development by other members of the CTA consortium.

The source code is currently hosted on a `GitHub repository <https://github.com/cta-observatory/protopipe>`__ 
to which this documentation is linked.  
It will soon migrate to the CTAO-GitLab installation under the ASWG group
repository (`link <https://gitlab.cta-observatory.org/cta-consortium/aswg>`__).

Current performance is stored internally at `this RedMine page <https://forge.in2p3.fr/projects/benchmarks-reference-analysis/wiki/Protopipe_performance_data>`__.

.. warning::
  This is not yet stable code, so expect large and rapid changes.
