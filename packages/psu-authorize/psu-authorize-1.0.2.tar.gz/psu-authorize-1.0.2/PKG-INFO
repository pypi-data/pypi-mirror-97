Description: # PSU-Authorize
        Reusable Django app specifically for PSU's custom-built web applications.  
        Provides the ability to manage authorizations in any site using the psu_base plugin.  
        
        ## Quick Start
        
        ### Dependencies
        The following dependency is REQUIRED and must be installed in your app:
        - [psu-base](https://pypi.org/project/psu-base/)
        
        ### Installation
        ```shell script
        pip install psu-authorize
        ```
        
        ### Configuration
        1. Configure [psu-base](https://pypi.org/project/psu-base/) in your Django app
        1. Add PSU-Authorize to your INSTALLED_APPS in `settings.py`:
            ```python
            INSTALLED_APPS = [
               ...
               'psu_base',
               'psu_authorize',
            ]
            ```
        1. Configure your app's top-level `urls.py` to include Authorization views:
            ```python
            urlpatterns = [
                ...
                path('authorize/', include(('psu_authorize.urls', 'psu_authorize'), namespace='authorize')),
            ]
        
        ## Usage

        ## For Developers
