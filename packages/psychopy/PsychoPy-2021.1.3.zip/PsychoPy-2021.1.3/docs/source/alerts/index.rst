Alerts
=====================================

The PsychoPy Alerts system is designed to provide you information of varying levels about things that may be a concern in your study (but equally may not be - it depends on your study!). Alerts show up within PsychoPy with a code and that code should take you here for detailed information about the root cause of the problem, the workarounds, and the type of study that might be badly affected by this issue.
