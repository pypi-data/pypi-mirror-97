Textbox Component
-------------------------------

This component can be used either to present text to the participant, or to allow free-text answers via the keyboard.

name : string
    Everything in a PsychoPy experiment needs a unique name. The name should contain only letters, numbers and underscores (no punctuation marks or spaces).
    
start :
    The time that the stimulus should first appear. See :ref:`startStop` for details.

stop : 
    The duration for which the stimulus is presented. See :ref:`startStop` for details.

editable : bool
    Whether this Textbox can be edited by the participant (text input) or not (static text).

text : string
    Text to be shown

Appearance
==========
How should the stimulus look? Colour, borders, etc.

text color : color
    See :ref:`colorspaces`

fill color : color
    See :ref:`colorspaces`

border color : color
    See :ref:`colorspaces`

color space : rgb, dkl, lms, hsv
    See :ref:`colorspaces`

border width : int | float
    How wide should the line be? Width is specified in chosen spatial units, see :doc:`../../general/units`

opacity :
    Vary the transparency, from 0.0 = invisible to 1.0 = opaque

Layout
======
How should the stimulus be laid out? Padding, margins, size, position, etc.

flip horizontal : bool
    Whether to mirror-reverse the text horizontally (left-right mirroring)

flip vertical : bool
    Whether to mirror-reverse the text vertically (top-bottom mirroring)

ori : degrees
    The orientation of the stimulus in degrees.

pos : [X,Y]
    The position of the centre of the stimulus, in the units specified by the stimulus or window

size : (width, height)
    Size of the stimulus on screen

spatial units : deg, cm, pix, norm, or inherit from window
    See :doc:`../../general/units`

padding : float
    How much space should there be between the box edge and the text?

anchor : center, center-left, center-right, top-left, top-center, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-center, bottom-right
    What point on the textbox should be anchored to its position? For example, if the position of the TextBox is (0, 0), should the middle of the textbox be in the middle of the screen, should its top left corner be in the middle of the screen, etc.?

Formatting
==========
Formatting text

font : string
    What font should the text be set in? Can be a font installed on your computer, saved to the "fonts" folder in your PsychoPy user folder or (if you are connected to the internet), a font from Google Fonts.

language style : LTR, RTL, Arabic
    Should text be laid out from left to right (LTR), from right to left (RTL), or laid out like Arabic script?

letter height : integer or float
    The height of the characters in the given units of the stimulus/window. Note that nearly all actual letters will occupy a smaller space than this, depending on font, character, presence of accents etc. The width of the letters is determined by the aspect ratio of the font.

line spacing : float
    How tall should each line be, proportional to the size of the font?
