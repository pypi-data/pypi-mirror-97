Integrating with Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sorry, the documentation for this hasn't yet been written.

The features are in place to do this, and the general description of how to make it work are on the page :ref:`recruitingOnline`.

.. warning:: Using Mechanical truk (MTurk)

    Note that Mechanical Turk was not designed with behavioural science in mind, but as a way for Amazon to test computing technologies in cases where a human was needed to push the buttons. They don't particularly care about the quality of this behavioral data as a result, nor about the ethics of the participants involved.

    To get better quality data, and to run studies that your local ethical review board is less likely to be concerned about, then we would suggest you use a dedicated service like `Prolific Academic <https://prolific.ac>`_ instead.
