fastKDE
=======

Software Overview
-----------------

fastKDE calculates a kernel density estimate of arbitrarily dimensioned
data; it does so rapidly and robustly using recently developed KDE
techniques. It does so with statistical skill that is as good as
state-of-the-science 'R' KDE packages, and it does so 10,000 times
faster for bivariate data (even better improvements for higher
dimensionality).

Example usage:

For a standard PDF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    #!python
     
    import numpy as np
    from fastkde import fastKDE
    import pylab as PP

    #Generate two random variables dataset (representing 100000 pairs of datapoints)
    N = 2e5
    var1 = 50*np.random.normal(size=N) + 0.1
    var2 = 0.01*np.random.normal(size=N) - 300
      
    #Do the self-consistent density estimate
    myPDF,axes = fastKDE.pdf(var1,var2)

    #Extract the axes from the axis list
    v1,v2 = axes

    #Plot contours of the PDF should be a set of concentric ellipsoids centered on
    #(0.1, -300) Comparitively, the y axis range should be tiny and the x axis range
    #should be large
    PP.contour(v1,v2,myPDF)
    PP.show()



For a conditional PDF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code generates samples from a non-trivial joint
distribution

.. code:: python

	from fastkde import fastKDE
	import pylab as PP
	import numpy as np

	#***************************
	# Generate random samples
	#***************************
	# Stochastically sample from the function underlyingFunction() (a sigmoid):
	# sample the absicissa values from a gamma distribution
	# relate the ordinate values to the sample absicissa values and add
	# noise from a normal distribution

	#Set the number of samples
	numSamples = int(1e6)

	#Define a sigmoid function
	def underlyingFunction(x,x0=305,y0=200,yrange=4):
	     return (yrange/2)*np.tanh(x-x0) + y0

	xp1,xp2,xmid = 5,2,305  #Set gamma distribution parameters
	yp1,yp2 = 0,12          #Set normal distribution parameters (mean and std)

	#Generate random samples of X from the gamma distribution
	x = -(np.random.gamma(xp1,xp2,int(numSamples))-xp1*xp2) + xmid
	#Generate random samples of y from x and add normally distributed noise
	y = underlyingFunction(x) + np.random.normal(loc=yp1,scale=yp2,size=numSamples)

**Now that we have the x,y samples, the following code calcuates the
conditional**

.. code:: python

    #***************************
    # Calculate the conditional
    #***************************
    pOfYGivenX,axes = fastKDE.conditional(y,x)

The following plot shows the results:

.. code:: python

    #***************************
    # Plot the conditional
    #***************************
    fig,axs = PP.subplots(1,2,figsize=(10,5))

    #Plot a scatter plot of the incoming data
    axs[0].plot(x,y,'k.',alpha=0.1)
    axs[0].set_title('Original (x,y) data')

    #Set axis labels
    for i in (0,1):
        axs[i].set_xlabel('x')
        axs[i].set_ylabel('y')

    #Draw a contour plot of the conditional
    axs[1].contourf(axes[0],axes[1],pOfYGivenX,64)
    #Overplot the original underlying relationship
    axs[1].plot(axes[0],underlyingFunction(axes[0]),linewidth=3,linestyle='--',alpha=0.5)
    axs[1].set_title('P(y|x)')

    #Set axis limits to be the same
    xlim = [np.amin(axes[0]),np.amax(axes[0])]
    ylim = [np.amin(axes[1]),np.amax(axes[1])]
    axs[1].set_xlim(xlim)
    axs[1].set_ylim(ylim)
    axs[0].set_xlim(xlim)
    axs[0].set_ylim(ylim)

    fig.tight_layout()

    PP.savefig('conditional_demo.png')
    PP.show()
