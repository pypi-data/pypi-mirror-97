# py_everything

A python module containing all the functions and classes from basic to advanced for Python. From simple calculations  to advanced file encryption. **Everything** is included in this one package.

It allows you to use all of its functions and classes without having to write huge complex code. It is a very simple and easy to use library. 

# Installation

py_everything is available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/py_everything), and you can install it as follows:

```
$ python -m pip install py_everything
```
py_everything officially supports Python 3.5+

# Features

- You can make use of the thousands of functions and classes available to you.
- Simple and easy to use
- You don't have to write all of that code yourself, just call the pre-made functions.
- You can inherit from our base class, and make your own with customizations.
- There are two variants of most classes, a `Base` variant and an `Advanced` variant.
- Make your own classes from our pre-provided `Base` variants. The Advanced ones are not for inheriting, but there is no problem in experimenting.
