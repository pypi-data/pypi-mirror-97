The quality of the diagram output by `py2puml` depends on the reliability with which the type annotations were written\n\n> The Python runtime does not enforce function and variable type annotations. They can be used by third party tools such as type checkers, IDEs, linters, etc.\n\n* complex type hints with more than one level of genericity are not properly handled for the moment: `List[MyClass]` or `Dict[str, MyClass]` are handled properly, `Dict[str, List[MyClass]]` is not. If your domain classes (also called business objects or DTOs) have attributes with complex type hints, it may be a code smell indicating that you should write a class which would better represent the business logic. But I may improve this part of the library as well ðŸ˜€\n\n* `py2puml` outputs diagrams in PlantUML syntax, which can be saved in text files along your python code and versioned with them. To generate image files, use the PlantUML runtime or a docker image (see [think/plantuml](https://hub.docker.com/r/think/plantuml))\n\n* `py2puml` uses features of python 3 (generators for example) and thus won\'t work with python 2 runtimes. It relies on native python modules and uses no 3rd-party library, except [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) as a development dependency for running the unit-tests\n\nIf you like tools around PlantUML, you may also be interested in this [lucsorel/plantuml-file-loader](https://github.com/lucsorel/plantuml-file-loader) project: A webpack loader which converts PlantUML files into images during the webpack processing (useful to [include PlantUML diagrams in your slides](https://github.com/lucsorel/markdown-image-loader/blob/master/README.md#web-based-slideshows) with RevealJS or RemarkJS).\n\n# Install\n\nInstall from PyPI:\n\n* with `pip`:\n\n```sh\npip install py2puml\n```\n\n* with [poetry](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):\n\n```sh\npoetry add py2puml\n```\n\n* with [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):\n\n```sh\npipenv install py2puml\n```\n\n# Usage\n\n## CLI\n\nOnce `py2puml` is installed at the system level, an eponymous command is available in your environment shell.\n\nFor example, to create the diagram of the classes used by `py2puml`, one can use:\n```sh\npy2puml py2puml/domain py2puml.domain\n```\n\nThis will output the following PlantUML script:\n\n```plantuml\n@startuml\nclass py2puml.domain.umlclass.UmlAttribute {\n  name: str\n  type: str\n}\nclass py2puml.domain.umlclass.UmlClass {\n  attributes: List[UmlAttribute]\n}\nclass py2puml.domain.umlitem.UmlItem {\n  name: str\n  fqdn: str\n}\nclass py2puml.domain.umlenum.Member {\n  name: str\n  value: str\n}\nclass py2puml.domain.umlenum.UmlEnum {\n  members: List[Member]\n}\nenum py2puml.domain.umlrelation.RelType {\n  COMPOSITION: *\n  INHERITANCE: <|\n}\nclass py2puml.domain.umlrelation.UmlRelation {\n  source_fqdn: str\n  target_fqdn: str\n  type: RelType\n}\npy2puml.domain.umlclass.UmlClass *-- py2puml.domain.umlclass.UmlAttribute\npy2puml.domain.umlitem.UmlItem <|-- py2puml.domain.umlclass.UmlClass\npy2puml.domain.umlenum.UmlEnum *-- py2puml.domain.umlenum.Member\npy2puml.domain.umlitem.UmlItem <|-- py2puml.domain.umlenum.UmlEnum\npy2puml.domain.umlrelation.UmlRelation *-- py2puml.domain.umlrelation.RelType\n@enduml\n```\n\nUsing PlantUML, this script renders this diagram:\n\n![py2puml UML Diagram](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/png/ZP91IyGm48Nl-HKvBsmF7iiUTbaA1jnMQZs9I7OxIY19Qp8H5jV_xZIse5GsFULrQBvvCozRZz9XC9gTjFIUz-URdhwojZDIsOnah6UFHkyGdJe61Fx9EBVIGCuzEj9uxaVzbSRi1n4HSWBwdDyfZq-_cpnVOIa4Cw04dJCph--jJPa16qns07C4Dxl_8NM0HG1oKD0P2IR2fa5-qCC8mu__t7UW9QhEPZNeXhON6VlgS5yzY4PKPSvNL13bRL6BPbVkYvnlBdC_SnvvgaSTcRuBxWGlSIbJMjAz0SRItm17BzGc6TzglLxqL5WYlCs5GAbkBB5_CdCzuoKk4Y6pPJkFNj9niotObkhi6m00)\n\nFor a full overview of the CLI, run:\n\n```sh\npy2puml --help\n```\n\nThe CLI can also be launched as a python module:\n\n```sh\npython -m py2puml py2puml/domain py2puml.domain\n```\n\nPipe the result of the CLI with a PlantUML server for instantaneous documentation (rendered by ImageMagick):\n\n```sh\n# runs a local PlantUML server from a docker container:\ndocker run -d -p 1234:8080 --name plantumlserver plantuml/plantuml-server:jetty \n\npy2puml py2puml/domain py2puml.domain | curl -X POST --data-binary @- http://localhost:1234/svg/ --output - | display\n\n# stops the container when you don\'t need it anymore, restarts it later, removes it\ndocker stop plantumlserver\ndocker start plantumlserver\ndocker rm plantumlserver\n```\n\n## Python API\n\nFor example, to create the diagram of the classes used by `py2puml`:\n\n* import the py2puml function in your script (see [py2puml/example.py](py2puml/example.py)):\n\n```python\nfrom py2puml.py2puml import py2puml\n\n# outputs the PlantUML content in the terminal\nprint(\'\'.join(py2puml(\'py2puml/domain\', \'py2puml.domain\')))\n\n# writes the PlantUML content in a file\nwith open(\'py2puml/domain.puml\', \'w\') as puml_file:\n    puml_file.writelines(py2puml(\'py2puml/domain\', \'py2puml.domain\'))\n```\n* running it (`python3 -m py2puml.example`) will output the previous PlantUML diagram in the terminal and write it in a file.\n\n\n# Tests\n\n```sh\n# directly with poetry\npoetry run python -m pytest -v\n\n# in a virtual environment\npython3 -m pytest -v\n```\n\n# Changelog\n\n* `0.4.0`: add a simple CLI\n* `0.3.1`: inspect sub-folders recursively\n* `0.3.0`: handle classes derived from namedtuples (attribute types are `any`)\n* `0.2.0`: handle inheritance relationships and enums. Unit tested\n* `0.1.3`: first release, handle all module of a folder and compositions of domain classes\n\n# Licence\n\nUnless stated otherwise all works are licensed under the [MIT license](http://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html), a copy of which is included [here](LICENSE).\n\n# Contributions\n\n* [Luc Sorel-Giffo](https://github.com/lucsorel)\n* [Doyou Jung](https://github.com/doyou89)\n* [Julien Jerphanion](https://github.com/jjerphan)\n\nPull-requests are welcome and will be processed on a best-effort basis.\n\n\n# Alternatives\n\nIf `py2puml` does not meet your needs (suggestions and pull-requests are **welcome**), you can have a look at these projects which follow other approaches (AST, linting, modeling):\n\n* [cb109/pyplantuml](https://github.com/cb109/pyplantuml)\n* [deadbok/py-puml-tools](https://github.com/deadbok/py-puml-tools)\n* [caballero/genUML](https://github.com/jose-caballero/genUML)\n',
