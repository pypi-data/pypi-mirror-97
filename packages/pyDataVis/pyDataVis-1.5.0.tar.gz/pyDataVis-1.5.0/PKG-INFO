Description: # pyDataVis
        
        **pyDataVis** is an open source application for interactive visualization, analysis and manipulation of scientific data. There are many [free plotting software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Free_plotting_software) most of them far more powerful than *pyDataVis*. However, in terms of simplicity, it is hard to beat. Indeed it is designed to be very easy to use, just drag and drop your data file in *pyDataVis* window and immediately you are seeing the curves. For now, *pyDataVis* is limited to 2D plotting.
        
        *pyDataVis* is written in [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) and use [PyQt](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/) as graphic user interface (GUI) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### Installation from Debian package
        This package can be found on the [website](https://pyDataVis.github.io) of pyDataVis, in [Downloads page](https://pydatavis.github.io/Downloads.html).
        Assuming that the .deb file is in Downloads folder, to install, open a Terminal and type:
        ```
        cd Downloads
        sudo dpkg -i pyDataVis.deb
        ```
        
        ### Installation with Windows installer
        This installer can be found on the [website](https://pyDataVis.github.io) of pyDataVis, in [Downloads page](https://pydatavis.github.io/Downloads.html).
        
        
        ### Installation from the Python Package Index
        Open a Terminal and run:
        ```
        pip install pyDataVis
        ```
        Then to launch the application:
        ```
        pyDataVis
        ```
        
        ### Installation from source archives
        pyDataVis requires Python 3, PyQt5, Numpy, Pandas, Scipy and Matplotlib. The easiest way to install everything is to use Open Source [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) that will "just work" out of the box for Windows, macOS and common Linux platforms.
        
        The source archives can be found on the [website](https://pyDataVis.github.io) of pyDataVis, in [Downloads page](https://pydatavis.github.io/Downloads.html). Extract the archive to the place where you want to store the program.
        
        You can instead clone the repository if you have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.
        Open a Terminal and change the current working directory to the location where you want to clone pyDataVis, for example ~/myprog:
        ```
        cd ~/myprog
        ```
        Then type:
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/pyDataVis/pyDataVis.git
        ```
        
        To launch the application, change the current working directory to the pyDataVis folder, for example ~/myprog/pyDataVis:
        ```
        cd ~/myprog/pyDataVis
        ```
        and execute the pyDataVis.py script:
        ```
        python pyDataVis.py
        ```
        
        
        ## Support
        To display the manual, open the page https://pydatavis.github.io/ in your browser or use the *Help* option in the *Help* menu.
        
        The folder *examples*, in the source archives, contains files for testing almost all the function. For those who have not installed from source archives, they can be found on the [website](https://pyDataVis.github.io) of pyDataVis, in [Downloads page](https://pydatavis.github.io/Downloads.html).
