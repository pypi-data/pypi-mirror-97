AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE DES MOINES IA
1145 AM CST SAT JAN 5 2013

...UPDATED FOR 18Z AVIATION DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM /TODAY/...
FIRST BAND OF WAA MID AND HIGH CLOUDS ARE LIFTING INTO NRN IA AHEAD 
OF APPROACHING UPPER LEVEL LOW.  LOW LOCATED OVER SOUTH CENTRAL KS 
WILL PUSH NORTHEAST TODAY AND BRUSH THE SOUTHEAST PART OF THE CWA.  
IA WILL BETWEEN SYSTEMS AS SURFACE LOW OVER ND PUSHES SOUTHEAST 
TODAY AS WELL.  THE NORTHERN LOW AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL 
EFFECTIVELY TAKE OVER AND PUSH MOISTURE SOUTHEAST OF THE CWA BY 
EVENING.  WENT A LITTLE ABOVE MOS TEMPS FOR TODAY AND A FEW DEGREES 
ABOVE YESTERDAYS HIGHS.

...Bogus second line with a new
   line...

.LONG TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...
LARGE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL BUILD INTO THE PLAINS FOR THE
BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD. THIS WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES COOLER SUNDAY
WITH NORTHWEST FLOW. TEMPERATURES WILL WARM FOR MONDAY AS RIDGE
SHIFTS EAST AND SOUTHERLY FLOW INCREASES...ALONG WITH WAA. HAVE
KEPT TEMPERATURES WARMER ACROSS THE SOUTH EAST WHERE LACK OF
SNOW COVER HAS ALLOWED TEMPERATURES TO CLIMB. A WEAK FRONTAL
BOUNDARY WILL PUSH SOUTH LATE MONDAY...CURRENT TIMING ON THIS
FRONT HAS PASSAGE OVERNIGHT MONDAY...BUT IF TIMING SPEEDS UP WILL
SEE COOLER AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES BEHIND FROPA. FRONTAL PASSAGE
WILL BE DRY WITH VERY LIMITED MOISTURE.

FOCUS THEN SHIFTS TO LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM FOR LATE IN THE PERIOD.
AREA OF LOW PRESSURE WILL PUSH NE FROM SOUTHWESTERN TEXAS. MODELS
REMAIN IN VERY POOR AGREEMENT WITH HANDLING OF THIS SYSTEM. THE
GFS LIFTS THE LOW THROUGH ARKANSAS...WITH LITTLE IMPACT ON
IOWA. THE ECMWF REMAINS CONSISTENT WITH BRINGING LOW ACROSS
MISSOURI...WITH DEF ZONE PRECIPITATION AFFECTING IOWA. GEM MODEL
HAS ALSO TRENDED THIS WAY WITH RECENT RUNS. HAVE THEREFORE TRENDED
FORECAST TOWARDS ECMWF MODELS...REMAINING CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS
FORECASTS. RUN TO RUN TIMING WITH ECMWF REMAINS FAIRLY CONSISTENT
AS WELL...AND HAVE KEPT ONSET OF PRECIPITATION WEDNESDAY NIGHT.
WITH WARMER TEMPERATURES...PRECIPITATION TYPE COULD BECOME A
PROBLEM...BUT GIVEN TEMPERATURE PROFILES...HAVE KEPT A RAIN/SNOW
MIX...WITH A CHANGE OVER TO RAIN THURSDAY BEFORE BACK TO A MIX.
SYSTEM WILL PUSH OUT FOR THE END OF THE PERIOD...HOWEVER MODELS
ARE INDICATING ANOTHER AREA OF LOW PRESSURE PUSHING ACROSS THE
NORTHERN PLAINS WILL BRING ADDITIONAL CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION.
HOWEVER...AGAIN MODELS DO NOT HAVE GOOD AGREEMENT WITH TIMING AND
PLACEMENT OF THIS LOW AND MAY SEE A BREAK IN PRECIPITATION BETWEEN
SYSTEMS FRIDAY. GIVEN UNCERTAINTY...HAVE LEFT SLIGHT CHANCE FOR
PRECIPITATION THROUGH END OF PERIOD.

BREEZY.  A FEW SNOW SHOWERS MAY ALSO OCCUR IN THE WAKE OF THE LOW
