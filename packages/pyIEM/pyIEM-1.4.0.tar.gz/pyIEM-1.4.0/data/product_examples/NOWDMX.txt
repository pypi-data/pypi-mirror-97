.NOW...
ALTHOUGH FOG IS BEGINNING TO LIFT THERE ARE STILL SOME POCKETS OF DENSE
FOG OVER PARTS OF CENTRAL IOWA...MAINLY ALONG AND EAST OF
INTERSTATE 35 AND NORTH OF HIGHWAY 30. THE FOG IS REDUCING
VISIBILITY TO A QUARTER MILE LOCALLY WITH MOST LOCATIONS NOW
REPORTING A HALF MILE TO ONE MILE VISIBILITY. THE COMBINATION OF
THE FOG AND THE SUN HITTING THE SNOW PACK IS CAUSING ALMOST
BLINDING CONDITIONS. VISIBILITY WILL IMPROVE DRAMATICALLY IN THE
NEXT 2 HOURS BUT UNTIL THEN USE CAUTION WHILE DRIVING AND REDUCE
SPEED IN FOGGY AREAS.
