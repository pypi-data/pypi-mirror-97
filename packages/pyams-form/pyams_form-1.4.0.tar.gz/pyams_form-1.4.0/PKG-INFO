        What is PyAMS?
        ==============
        
        PyAMS (Pyramid Application Management Suite) is a small suite of packages written for applications
        and content management with the Pyramid framework.
        
        **PyAMS** is actually mainly used to manage web sites through content management applications (CMS,
        see PyAMS_content package), but many features are generic and can be used inside any kind of web
        application.
        
        All PyAMS documentation is available on `ReadTheDocs <https://pyams.readthedocs.io>`_; source code
        is available on `Gitlab <https://gitlab.com/pyams>`_ and pushed to `Github
        <https://github.com/py-ams>`_. Complete doctests are available in the *doctests* folder.
        
        
        What is PyAMS_form?
        ===================
        
        PyAMS_form is a fork of `z3c.form <https///github.com/zopefoundation/z3c.form>`_ package;
        it provides the same features to generate HTML forms based on schema interfaces, but adapted to
        the Pyramid framework for use with Chameleon templates.
        
        It is also adding a few features, with custom form-related viewlets managers and AJAX forms.
        
        ** Package API is also converted to common Python standards, using snake_case for variables and
        methods.
