        What is PyAMS?
        ==============
        
        PyAMS (Pyramid Application Management Suite) is a small suite of packages written for applications
        and content management with the Pyramid framework.
        
        **PyAMS** is actually mainly used to manage web sites through content management applications (CMS,
        see PyAMS_content package), but many features are generic and can be used inside any kind of web
        application.
        
        All PyAMS documentation is available on `ReadTheDocs <https://pyams.readthedocs.io>`_; source code
        is available on `Gitlab <https://gitlab.com/pyams>`_ and pushed to `Github
        <https://github.com/py-ams>`_.

        ===================
        
        PyAMS_mail is a small utility package for Pyramid which allows to register several mailing servers
        utilities through Pyramid's configuration file.
        
        It also provides a few mail-related interfaces and utilities, like messages classes which
