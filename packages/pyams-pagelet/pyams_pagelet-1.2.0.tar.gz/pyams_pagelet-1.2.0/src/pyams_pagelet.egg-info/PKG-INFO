        What is PyAMS
        =============
        
        PyAMS (Pyramid Application Management Suite) is a small suite of packages written for applications
        and content management with the Pyramid framework.
        
        **PyAMS** is actually mainly used to manage web sites through content management applications (CMS,
        see PyAMS_content package), but many features are generic and can be used inside any kind of web
        application.
        
        All PyAMS documentation is available on `ReadTheDocs <https://pyams.readthedocs.io>`_; source code
        is available on `Gitlab <https://gitlab.com/pyams>`_ and pushed to `Github
        <https://github.com/py-ams>`_.
        
        
        What is PyAMS_pagelet?
        ======================
        
        This package is a small rewrite of z3c.pagelet package for use with Pyramid and PyAMS.
        
        PyAMS_template allows to separate a view's Python code from it's template implementation, so that
        this template can be easily overriden for a given context, layer or view; it also allows to
        separate a "content" template from a "layout" template which is handling all common elements in
        a web page.
        
        PyAMS_pagelet is an implementation of this pattern: a pagelet is a Pyramid view registered with
        the name of the pagelet; the layout template can then just use a "${structure:provider:pagelet}"
        directive to automatically insert the pagelet matching the current browser URL.
