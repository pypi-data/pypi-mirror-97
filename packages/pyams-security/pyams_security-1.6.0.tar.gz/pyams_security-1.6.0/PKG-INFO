        What is PyAMS?
        ==============
        
        PyAMS (Pyramid Application Management Suite) is a small suite of packages written for applications
        and content management with the Pyramid framework.
        
        **PyAMS** is actually mainly used to manage web sites through content management applications (CMS,
        see PyAMS_content package), but many features are generic and can be used inside any kind of web
        application.
        
        All PyAMS documentation is available on `ReadTheDocs <https://pyams.readthedocs.io>`_; source code
        is available on `Gitlab <https://gitlab.com/pyams>`_ and pushed to `Github
        <https://github.com/py-ams>`_.
        
        
        What is PyAMS_security?
        =======================
        
        PyAMS_security is a core extension package for PyAMS which provides all main security-related
        features; the package provides a custom authentication policy which is based on a custom "security
        manager". This utility is a pluggable tool which is handling system users, local users and groups,
        as well as OAuth authentication; external packages can also provide authentication based
        on an LDAP directory.
        
        PyAMS_security also provides utilities to extract credentials from queries, like HTTP basic
        authentication or JWT tokens, and can also provide your own credentials extraction mechanisms.
        
        Finally, PyAMS_security provides roles management, as well as custom schema fields to store
        roles assigned to principals.
