        What is PyAMS?
        ==============
        
        PyAMS (Pyramid Application Management Suite) is a small suite of packages written for applications
        and content management with the Pyramid framework.
        
        **PyAMS** is actually mainly used to manage web sites through content management applications (CMS,
        see PyAMS_content package), but many features are generic and can be used inside any kind of web
        application.
        
        All PyAMS documentation is available on `ReadTheDocs <https://pyams.readthedocs.io>`_
        
        
        What is PyAMS_site?
        ===================
        
        PyAMS_site is an extension package for Pyramid and PyAMS frameworks. It provides a small set of
        features related to **sites**, which are the base components of any web site or application.
        
        One of the main features of PyAMS_site packages is the management of site's **generations**, which
        is largely based on *zope.generations* package (but with much less features); a *generation* is
        defined when a new version of any package is requiring database updates to convert
        contents by adding or updating properties, or renaming classes. But unlike other frameworks,
        PyAMS made the choice to **not** automatically do this conversion, which is done using the
        "pyams_upgrade" console script; the **zodbupdate** console script can also be used in a
        first step when some classes need to be renamed before doing an upgrade.
        
        PyAMS_site also provides a Pyramid's **root factory**, which is used by Pyramid on application
        startup to initialize a new site.
