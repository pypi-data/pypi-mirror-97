"""PyAMS_utils.registry module

This package is used to manage a *local registry*. A local registry is a *site management* component
created automatically on application startup by PyAMS_utils package. It can be used to store and
register components, mainly persistent utilities which are created and configured dynamically by a
site administrator; this can include SQLAlchemy engines, ZEO connections, and several PyAMS
utilities like security manager, medias converter, tasks scheduler and many other ones.

See :ref:`zca` to get a brief introduction about using a local registry with PyAMS packages.
