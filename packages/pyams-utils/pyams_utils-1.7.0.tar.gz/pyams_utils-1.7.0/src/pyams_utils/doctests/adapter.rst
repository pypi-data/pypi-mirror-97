PyAMS_utils adapter module
==========================

Adapters are components which are used to adapt a set of "input" objects instances, implementing
interfaces, to another object implementing another interface.

A lookup is done into components registry to find an available adapter for all these interfaces.

An adapter is nothing but a simple object; it doesn't have to inherit from anything, but it's
constructor must accept as many arguments as defined into adapter's "required" parameters length.

PyAMS_utils provides a small set of commonly used adapters:

    >>> from pyramid.testing import setUp, tearDown, DummyRequest
    >>> config = setUp(hook_zca=True)

    >>> from cornice import includeme as include_cornice
    >>> include_cornice(config)
    >>> from pyams_utils import includeme as include_utils
    >>> include_utils(config)

    >>> from pyams_utils import adapter

    >>> context, request, view = object(), object(), object()

    >>> context_adapter = adapter.ContextAdapter(context)
    >>> context_request_adapter = adapter.ContextRequestAdapter(context, request)
    >>> context_request_view_adapter = adapter.ContextRequestViewAdapter(context, request, view)

NullAdapter is a custom adapter which can be used to undefine an adapter in a given context:

    >>> null_adapter = adapter.NullAdapter(context, request)
    >>> null_adapter is None
    True


Annotations adapters
--------------------

Sometimes, some adapters have to store informations into one or more objects that they adapt
(generally the context); instead of using internal attributes which could conflict with properties
defined by other packages, we use annotations which are store in a custom "__annotations__" mapping
attribute; a custom factory is provided by PyAMS_utils to define and get such annotations:

    >>> from zope.interface import implementer, Interface
    >>> from zope.annotation.interfaces import IAttributeAnnotatable

    >>> class IMyContext(IAttributeAnnotatable):
    ...     """My context interface"""

    >>> @implementer(IMyContext)
    ... class MyContext:
    ...     """Context object class"""

    >>> class IMyAdapter(Interface):
    ...     """Adapter interface"""

    >>> @implementer(IMyAdapter)
    ... class MyAdapter:
    ...     """Adapter class"""
    ...     weight = 1
    ...     def __init__(self):
    ...         print("Creating adapter...")

    >>> def context_adapter_factory(context):
    ...     return adapter.get_annotation_adapter(context, "my.annotations.key", MyAdapter)

Adapter registration can be done using a decorator, but we register it manually for testing:

    >>> config.registry.registerAdapter(context_adapter_factory, (IMyContext,), IMyAdapter)

    >>> context = MyContext()
    >>> adapted = IMyAdapter(context)
    Creating adapter...
    >>> IMyAdapter.providedBy(adapted)
    True
    >>> 'my.annotations.key' in context.__annotations__
    True
    >>> context.__annotations__['my.annotations.key'] is adapted
    True

When calling the same adapter several times, the annotations lookup just returns the previously
created object:

    >>> IMyAdapter(context)
    <...MyAdapter object at 0x...>

The given "factory" argument value can be a factory or an interface; if an interface is provided,
a lookup is made for a registered factory for this interface:

    >>> from pyams_utils import factory
    >>> factory.register_factory(IMyAdapter, MyAdapter, registry=config.registry)

    >>> adapted = adapter.get_annotation_adapter(context, "my.annotations.key2", IMyAdapter,
    ...                                          registry=config.registry)
    Creating adapter...
    >>> context.__annotations__['my.annotations.key2'] is adapted
    True

If 'markers' argument is provided, this is a list of new interfaces that the new created object
will provide:

    >>> class IMyMarker1(Interface):
    ...     "First marker interface"

    >>> adapted = adapter.get_annotation_adapter(context, "my.annotations.key3", IMyAdapter,
    ...                                          markers=IMyMarker1, registry=config.registry)
    Creating adapter...
    >>> IMyMarker1.providedBy(adapted)
    True

By default, the context is set as parent of the new adapting object:

    >>> adapted.__parent__ is context
    True

If "parent" is set, this object will be defined as the parent instead of the context:

You can also define a callback which will be called after object creation:

    >>> adapted = adapter.get_annotation_adapter(context, "my.annotations.key4", IMyAdapter,
    ...                                          markers=IMyMarker1, registry=config.registry,
    ...                                          callback=lambda x: print('{!r}'.format(x)))
    Creating adapter...
    <...MyAdapter object at 0x...>

You can provide a default value to an annotation adapter:

    >>> adapter.get_annotation_adapter(context, "my.annotations.key5", IMyAdapter,
    ...                                default='default value')
    'default value'

If no factory interface is provided, result is also set to None:

    >>> adapter.get_annotation_adapter(context, "my.annotations.key6") is None
    True


Of course, trying to get annotations from an object which doesn't support them will return a
None value:

    >>> context = object()
    >>> adapter.get_annotation_adapter(context, "my.annotations.key", IMyAdapter) is None
    True


Registering adapters
--------------------

Adapters can be easilly registered using a custom decorator called "adapter_config":

    >>> from pyams_utils.testing import call_decorator

    >>> class ISimpleInterface(Interface):
    ...     """Simple marker interface"""

    >>> class SimpleAdapter(adapter.ContextAdapter):
    ...     """Simple adapter"""

    >>> call_decorator(config, adapter.adapter_config, SimpleAdapter,
    ...                required=str, provided=ISimpleInterface)

    >>> ISimpleInterface('string')
    <pyams_utils.tests.test_utilsdocs.SimpleAdapter object at 0x...>

If the adapter class doesn't implements the provided interface, the registration will
automatically add the interface to class implementations:

    >>> ISimpleInterface.implementedBy(SimpleAdapter)
    True

You can avoid the "provided" argument if your adapter implements a single interface:

    >>> @implementer(ISimpleInterface)
    ... class SimpleAdapter(adapter.ContextAdapter):
    ...     """Simple adapter"""

    >>> call_decorator(config, adapter.adapter_config, SimpleAdapter, for_=int)
    >>> ISimpleInterface(42)
    <pyams_utils.tests.test_utilsdocs.SimpleAdapter object at 0x...>

    >>> @implementer(IMyAdapter, ISimpleInterface)
    ... class SimpleAdapter(adapter.ContextAdapter):
    ...     """Simple adapter"""

    >>> call_decorator(config, adapter.adapter_config, SimpleAdapter, for_=int)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: Missing 'provides' argument


Sorting adapters
----------------

It can be required to sort adapters based on a "weight":

    >>> call_decorator(config, adapter.adapter_config, SimpleAdapter,
    ...                required=IMyContext, provided=IMyAdapter, name='second')

    >>> context = MyContext()
    >>> sorted(config.registry.getAdapters((context,), IMyAdapter),
    ...        key=adapter.get_adapter_weight)
    Creating adapter...
    [('second', <....SimpleAdapter object at 0x...>), ('', <...MyAdapter object at 0x...>)]


Tests cleanup:

  >>> tearDown()
