Description: # pyine
        A simple package for the conversion of tradingview's .pine to python script. 
        
        Currently Supports
         - Variable Decleration ```a = 1```
         - Dynamic Value Assignment ```a = b > c```
         - If statements
         - Alert functions (will act as a print statement but will have full support in the future)
         - Comments
        
        **Warning**
        The current version (1.1.1) will auto comment any strategy calls so it is advised that a study is used instead.
        
        
        ## Usage
        Pyine currently supports partial file conversion (good for simple pine script files) and the below indicators (based on their pine script equivelants)
        
        Indicators
         - Simple Moving Average
         - Exponential Moving Average
        
        
        ### Converter
        ```
        from pyine import convert
