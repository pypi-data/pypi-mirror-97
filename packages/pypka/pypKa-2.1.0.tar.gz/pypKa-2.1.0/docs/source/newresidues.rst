FF Extension
============

=====================
Adding extra residues
=====================

PypKa supports canonical amino acids and DNA bases, as well as some lipid molecules and ions. However, for many studies these are not sufficient and one might need to manually add these extra residues/molecules. PypKa supports out-of-the-box GROMOS54a7 and CHARMM36m FFs, but this recipe is transferable to other FFs as well.

For demonstration purposes, we will add an FMOC residue to the CHARMM36m FF for which the parameters have been kindly supplied by Alexander van Teijlingen.
DataBaseT.crg and DataBaseT.siz are the main files where the charges and radii of atoms need to be added.
The new DataBaseT files will be generated by extend_db.py (tmp.crg and tmp.siz) provided one follows the steps describe below.
If you believe your residue could benefit other users please create a pull request on GitHub or send the new parameters to the developers directly.

================================
Add residue block to aa.rtp file
================================

The lines should adhere to GROMACS .rtp file logic. Please use unique atom types to describe your residues in order to avoid clashes with previously declared atoms. Adding the suffix _RESIDUE to the intended atom type should be enough.

Add placeholder info on DataBaseT_old.crg and DataBaseT_old.siz
===============================================================

The X.XXX placeholder marks the atom as a new addition.

=============
Run extend_db
=============

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 extend_db.py


New tmp.crg and tmp.siz have been generated. Please inspect them to check the new residue has been added at the bottom correctly. After the visual inspection, rename them DataBaseT.crg and DataBaseT.siz, respectively.

.. code-block:: bash

   mv tmp.crg DataBaseT.crg
   mv tmp.siz DataBaseT.siz


======================
Add residue to pdb2pqr
======================

The residue also needs to be added to PDB2PQR's database of residues, so that is not discarded on the preprocessing step.
