                Sharpness Indicator, Histogram, etc.
* pylon Viewer: [66666] The slider control for the Exposure Time camera parameter
                now uses a logarithmic scale.
* pylon Viewer: [120403] Camera event data, e.g., Exposure End Event, is displayed
                in the feature tree now.
* pylon Viewer: [132170] An option to restore the window layout to default settings
                has been added in the Window menu.
* pylon Viewer: [109495] Added the Show Cameras Only option in the Devices pane.
                When selected, all transport layers and interfaces are hidden
                and only camera devices are displayed.
* pylon Viewer: [126270] The File Access feature now returns interactive feedback
                when uploading large amounts of user data, e.g., vignetting
                correction files.
* pylon Viewer: [123228] The pylon Viewer has been optimized for monitors with 4k
                and higher resolution.

                The Features pane now always shows all parameters of the selected
                camera.
* pylon Viewer: [127346] The pylon Viewer (Monitor Mode) used for multicasting
                with GigE cameras has been removed. Instead, right-click the
                desired GigE camera in the Devices pane of the pylon Viewer and
                click Open Device... > Monitor Mode to run the pylon Viewer in
                Monitor Mode.

                enables you to update all Basler cameras that support the GenICam
                Firmware Update Standard Version 2018.06, e.g., Basler ace 2, 
                Basler dart, Basler pulse.

                The GenICam cache may need to be deleted when an error condition has been
                cached that prevents the proper operation of the pylon Viewer.
* pylon Viewer: [139115] Added the shortcut CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+F7 that works as a toggle for switching
                off/switching on the display of images in pylon Viewer. Image acquisition must be
                running when the shortcut is initially used (switching off image display).

       This Universal Instant camera class provides users with a native parameter API
       that can be used for any interface.
* SDK: [100038] Added new samples showing the use of CBaslerUniversalInstantCamera
       and changed existing samples to show the use of parameter classes.

       that were written for GigE cameras based on GenICam SFNC 1.x so
       that they work with GigE cameras based on SFNC 2.x as well, e.g.,
       Basler ace 2 GigE cameras.
* SDK: [139226] Added the Utility_IpConfig sample, which illustrates how to configure the IP
       address of GigE cameras. In addition, this sample can be used to automatically and
	   programmatically configure multiple GigE Vision cameras.
* SDK: [127827] Added the Utility_ImageDecompressor sample, which illustrates how to enable
       the compression feature in Basler ace 2 Pro cameras and how to decompress the images
	   using the CImageDecompressor class.
* SDK: [144475] New parameters for Basler ace 2 Pro camera and the Basler SLP Controller have been
       added to the CBaslerUniversalInstantCamera class.
* SDK/USB3: [149732] A new stream grabber statistic parameter called “Statistic_Out_Of_Memory_Error_Count”
            has been added. It provides information about insufficient memory on the host.
* SDK: [136974] Added GetBufferSize() function to GrabResultData and GrabResult to query the
       actual size of the grab result buffer.
* SDK: [136974] Added additional enumeration entries with correct GrabStatus_ prefix to EGrabStatus
       to conform with the naming scheme of enumerations. Old entries can still be used for
       backwards compatibility.
* SDK: [100038] Added parameter classes for simplifying access to GenApi parameters,
       e.g., CIntegerParameter.
       These can be used instead of GenApi::CXYZPtr classes.
* SDK: [100038] Changed the existing configuration classes, e.g., CAcquireContinuousConfiguration,
       to use new parameter classes.
* SDK: [100038] Access methods and keys of transport layer-specific device info
       classes have been merged into CDeviceInfo.
* SDK: [102881] The image format converter now also supports the PixelType_YCbCr422_8_YY_CbCr_Semiplanar
       and PixelType_YCbCr420_8_YY_CbCr_Semiplanar input formats.
* SDK: [121880] Buffers can be cleared (filled with 0) using the ClearBufferModeEnable
       parameter of the InstantCamera class.
* SDK: [120870] Calling AcquisitionStart and AcquisitionStop in InstantCamera can be enabled
       or disabled using the parameter AcquisitionStartStopExecutionEnable of the
       InstantCamera class.
* SDK: [133422] If the DeviceUserID of the camera is empty, an empty UserDefinedName entry
       will be added to the DeviceInfo object.
* SDK: [132430] Added missing documentation for CTlFactory functions.
* USB3: [55923] The Libusb error memory limit handling has been improved.
* GigE Vision: [126099] Added mapping of YCbCr422_8 pixel type to
                Pylon::PixelType_YUV422_YUYV_Packed in GigE Vision transport layer
                for ace 2 GigE cameras.
* pylon: [113461] The PylonFirmwareUpdater supports ace 2 USB3 Vision and GigE Vision and dart 
         cameras.
* CamEmu: [102456] CamEmu now also supports BayerGR8, BayerRG8, BayerGB8, and
          BayerBG8 pixel formats.
