# this script tells scoop which cluster nodes to use; they must all be accessible via ssh without a password
# the first entry of each line is the name of a node, the second the number of processes
# one is enough for our case as each process is further parallelized by pathos on the node
node1 1
node2 1
node3 1
node4 1
node5 1
