## [v0.4.5] - 2021-03-03
[v0.4.5]: https://github.com/althonos/pyrodigal/compare/v0.4.4...v0.4.5

### Fixed
- Compilation of OSX and Windows wheels.


## [v0.4.4] - 2021-03-03
[v0.4.4]: https://github.com/althonos/pyrodigal/compare/v0.4.3...v0.4.4

### Fixed

- Compilation of PyPy wheels on OSX.


## [v0.4.3] - 2021-03-01
[v0.4.3]: https://github.com/althonos/pyrodigal/compare/v0.4.2...v0.4.3

### Fixed
- Buffer overflow when running in `meta` mode on a sequence too small to have any dynamic programming nodes.


## [v0.4.2] - 2021-02-07
[v0.4.2]: https://github.com/althonos/pyrodigal/compare/v0.4.1...v0.4.2

### Fixed
- Buffer overflow coming from the node array, caused by an incorrect
  estimation of the node count from the sequence length.

[v0.4.1]: https://github.com/althonos/pyrodigal/compare/v0.4.0...v0.4.1

### Removed
- Python 3.5 from the project metadata (the code was only compatible with
  Python 3.6+ already because of *f-strings*).

### Fixed
- Broken linking of static `libprodigal` against the `_pyrodigal` extension
  on some OSX environments ([bioconda/bioconda-recipes#25568](https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/pull/25568)).

### Changed
- `trans_table` keyword argument to `Pyrodigal.train` has been renamed
  to `translation_table`.

### Added
- Option to change the translation table to any allowed number in `Gene.translate`
  ([#1](https://github.com/althonos/pyrodigal/issues/1)).
