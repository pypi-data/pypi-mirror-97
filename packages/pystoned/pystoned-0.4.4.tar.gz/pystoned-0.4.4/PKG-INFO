Description: # pyStoNED [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pystoned/badge/?version=latest)](https://pystoned.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)
        
        `pyStoNED` is a Python package that provides functions for estimating Convex Nonparametric Least Square (CNLS), Stochastic Nonparametric Envelopment of Data (StoNED), and other various StoNED-related variants (e.g., CQR, ICNLS). It allows the user to estimate the CNLS/StoNED models in an open-access environment rather than in commercial software, e.g., GAMS, MATLAB. The `pyStoNED` package is built based on the [PYOMO](http://www.pyomo.org/).
