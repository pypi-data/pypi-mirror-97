    When the blazar CLI client got an error code from the blazar server,
    it didn't display error messages created in the blazar server.
    Instead, it displayed `messages created in keystoneauth`_ with poor
    information. See the `bug report`_ for example.
    It was fixed to display original error messages which include useful
    information.
