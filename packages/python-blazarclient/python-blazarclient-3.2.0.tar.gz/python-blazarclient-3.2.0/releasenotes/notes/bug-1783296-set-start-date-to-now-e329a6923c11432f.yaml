    When creating a lease using the CLI client, the default value for start
    date was changed to use the string 'now', which is resolved to the current
    time on the server rather than on the client. Note that if the request is
    sent at the end of a minute and interpreted by the service at the beginning of
    the next minute, this can result in leases that are one minute shorter than
    what the user might expect, as the end date is still specified by the
    client. Users who care about the exact timing of their leases should
    explicitly specify both start and end dates.
fixes:
  - |
    Creating a lease using the CLI client without specifying a start date no
    longer fails if the request is sent to the Blazar service just before the
    end of a minute. For more details, see `bug 1783296
