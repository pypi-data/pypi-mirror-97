features:
  - A new ``event post`` API was added in order to support the OPNFV Doctor
    Inspector requirements. It can be used for posting events from an external
    monitor or datasource to Vitrage.
    In the Doctor use case, if a ``compute.host.down`` event is posted, then
    it is handled by the new ``Doctor Datasource``.
