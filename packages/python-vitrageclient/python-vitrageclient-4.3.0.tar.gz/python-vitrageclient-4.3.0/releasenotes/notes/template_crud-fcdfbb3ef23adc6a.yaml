features:
  - New CLI commands were added - template add and template delete.
    Templates can now be added/removed by CLI commands while vitrage is running
    (no restart is required). Templates are stored in the database and remain after
    restarting vitrage. Adding/removing a template at runtime preforms a live
    update to the entity graph.
