class DistributedCircuit(circuit.Circuit):
    """Distributed implementation of :class:`qibo.abstractions.circuit.AbstractCircuit` in Tensorflow.

    Uses multiple `accelerator` devices (GPUs) for applying gates to the state vector.
    The full state vector is saved in the given `memory device` (usually the CPU)
    during the simulation. A gate is applied by splitting the state to pieces
    and copying each piece to an accelerator device that is used to perform the
    matrix multiplication. An `accelerator` device can be used more than once
    resulting to logical devices that are more than the physical accelerators in
    the system.

    Distributed circuits currently do not support native tensorflow gates,
    compilation and callbacks.

    Example:
        ::

            from qibo.models import Circuit
            # The system has two GPUs and we would like to use each GPU twice
            # resulting to four total logical accelerators
            accelerators = {'/GPU:0': 2, '/GPU:1': 2}
            # Define a circuit on 32 qubits to be run in the above GPUs keeping
            # the full state vector in the CPU memory.
            c = Circuit(32, accelerators, memory_device="/CPU:0")

    Args:
        nqubits (int): Total number of qubits in the circuit.
        accelerators (dict): Dictionary that maps device names to the number of
            times each device will be used.
            The total number of logical devices must be a power of 2.
        memory_device (str): Name of the device where the full state will be
            saved (usually the CPU).
