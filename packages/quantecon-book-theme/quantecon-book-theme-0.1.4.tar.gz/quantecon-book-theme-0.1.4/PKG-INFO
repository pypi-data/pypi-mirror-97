        ## Updating Fixtures for Tests
        
        ### Updating test regression files on layout changes
        
        It is advisable to update the test files for file regression checks when releavant layout files change.
        
        For example, at present we have a sidebar file-regression check to validate html across tests.
        The file which it compares against is `tests/test_build/test_build_book.html`.
        
        If updating the sidebar html, then one of the easier steps to update this test file is:
        
        1. Delete the file `tests/test_build/test_build_book.html`.
        2. Run `pytest` in your command line, which will then generate a new file. Check if the file is at par with your expectations, contains elements which you added/modified.
        
        Now future pytests will test against this file, and the subsequent tests should pass.
