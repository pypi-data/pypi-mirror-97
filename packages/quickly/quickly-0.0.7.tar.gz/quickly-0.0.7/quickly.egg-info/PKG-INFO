        The quickly python package is slated to become the successor of python-ly.
        
        It is currently in a very early development phase.
        
        Like python-ly, it will provide tools to manipulate `LilyPond`_ music
        documents, but instead of using the lexer in python-ly, which is very difficult
        to maintain, it will use the new `parce`_ package for parsing LilyPond files.
        
        .. _LilyPond: http://lilypond.org/
        .. _parce: https://parce.info/
        
        ``ly.dom`` and ``ly.music`` will be superseded by ``quickly.dom`` which will
        provide a way to both build a LilyPond source file from scratch (like
        ``ly.dom``) and manipulate an existing document (like ``ly.music``). It is also
        expected that much of the functionality that is currently implemented at the
        token level, like transposing and rhythm manipulations, can be rewritten to
        work on the musical representation provided by ``quickly.dom``, which will look
        a lot like ``ly.music``.
        
        This module is written and maintained by Wilbert Berendsen, and will, as it
        grows, also contain (adapted) code from python-ly that was contributed by
        others. Python 3.6 and higher is supported. Besides Python itself the most
        recent version of the *parce* module is needed. Testing is done by running
        ``pytest-3`` in the root directory.
