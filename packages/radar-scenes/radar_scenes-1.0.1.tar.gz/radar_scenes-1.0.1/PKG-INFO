Description: # RadarScenes Tools
        
        ## About
        ![viewer example](https://github.com/oleschum/radar_scenes/blob/master/doc/viewer.png?raw=true)
        
        This python package provides some helper scripts for the [RadarScenes](http://radar-scenes.com) dataset. 
        
        Among others, the package contains a viewer for the radar data and camera images from the dataset.
        
        ## Installation
        
        The package is designed for Python versions `>=3.6` and can be installed using `pip`. Installation using `pip` is the
        recommended method. 
        
        The alternative is to clone this repository and manually install the package using the `setup.py`.
        
        ###Virtual Environment
        It is *highly recommended* to install the package in its own virtual environment. To do so, create a virtual environment 
        prior to installation of the package:
        
        ```
        python3 -m venv ~/.virtualenvs/radar_scenes
        ```
        This will create a python virtual environment called `radar_scenes` in the folder `.virtualenvs` in your home directory.
        
        This environment can be activated via
        ```
        source ~/.virtualenvs/radar_scenes/bin/activate
        ```
        An active virtual environment is indicated by a preceding `(radar_scenes)` line before the usual bash prompt.
        
        Once the virtual environment is active, the package can be installed with the command
        
        ```
        pip install radar_scenes
        ```
        You do not have to clone this repository for the installation.
        
        There are multiple guides available which give more information about virtual environments and installation of python
        packages, e.g. on [python.org](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).
        ###System wide installation
        If no virtual environment is desired (again, this is __discouraged__!) , the package can be installed using the global version of `pip`
        ```
        pip3 install --user radar_scenes
        ```
        The flag `--user` can be omitted if a system wide installation is desired (may require root privileges).

        Please refer to www.radar-scenes.com to get instructions on how to cite the data set. 
        
        
        ##Usage
        
        After successful installation, the `radar_scenes` package is available in your python environment.
        
        ###Radar Data Viewer
        During installation, the command `rad_viewer` is made available. If you have installed the package into a virtual
        environment, this command is only available while the virtual environment is active.
        
        Calling `rad_viewer` launches the radar data viewer. As an optional command line argument, a path to a `*.json` file 
        from the RadarScenes dataset can be provided. The sequence will then be loaded directly on start up.
        
        Example:
        ```
        (radar_scenes)
        $ rad_viewer ~/datasets/radar_scenes/data/sequence_128/scenes.json
        ```
        
        The time slider itself or the arrow keys on your keyboard can be used to scroll through the sequence.
