Getting Started
================
Installation
--------------
The recommended way to install this software is with `pip`:

```
pip install rcwa
```

And that's it! 

Hello World Program
----------------------
To run a simple example, run:

```
python -m rcwa.examples.bragg_mirror
```

This should run an example with a 10-layer bragg mirror (also known as a [dielectric mirror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric_mirror)), which can have very high reflectance near its design wavelength, and output the reflectance as a function of wavelength.

Features
==========
- Implements 1D Transfer Matrix Method for homogenous layers
- Implements full rectangular 2D RCWA for periodic layers
- Huge material database for n/k values in optical range built-in based on [refractiveindex.info](https://refractiveindex.info/), including metals, plastics, glass, and ceramics
- Compute reflection and transmission spectra at arbitrary incidence and polarization
- Compute spectroscopic ellipsometry curves
- Exactly solves Maxwell's Equations for arbitrary layer stacks of any thickness
- Compute reflected power, transmitted power, and S-parameters
- Easy to use class-based syntax 
- Large, fast-to-run test suite
- Extremely fast narrowband, rigorously correct simulations well suited for resonant devices

Example Uses
==============
- Compute reflected and transmitted power from a thin film stack
- Determine resonant frequency of a VCSEL
- Determine reflectance of a bragg mirror, on or off-axis
- Find diffraction efficiencies for a 1D or 2D diffraction grating
- Compute reflected power from a metallic mirror
