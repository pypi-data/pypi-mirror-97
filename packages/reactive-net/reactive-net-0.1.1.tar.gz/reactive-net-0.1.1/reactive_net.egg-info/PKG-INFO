Description: # reactive-net
        Python library for managing network communications
        
        Network messages are of three types:
        
        - `Message`
          - Format: `<size u16><payload>`
          - This is not used in practice
        - `CommandMessage`
          - Format: `<code u16><size u16><payload>`
        - `ResultMessage`
          - Format: `<code u8><size u16><payload>`
        
        
        
        ## Command Messages
        
        ```python
        class ReactiveCommand(IntEnum):
            Connect             = 0x0
            Call                = 0x1
            RemoteOutput        = 0x2
            Load                = 0x3
            Ping                = 0x4
            RegisterEntrypoint  = 0x5
            Output              = 0x6 # called by software modules in SGX and Native
            RemoteRequest       = 0x7
        ```
        
        - Not all the commands have a response! (ResultMessage)
          - `RemoteOutput` and `Output` does not have response.
        
        ## Result Messages
        
        ```python
        class ReactiveResult(IntEnum):
            Ok                  = 0x0
            IllegalCommand      = 0x1
            IllegalPayload      = 0x2
            InternalError       = 0x3
            BadRequest          = 0x4
            CryptoError         = 0x5
            GenericError        = 0x6
        ```
