        ## Overview
        RepoBee is a command line tool that allows teachers and teaching assistants
        to administrate large amounts of Git repositories on the GitHub and GitLab
        platforms (cloud and self-hosted). The most basic use case is to automate
        generation of student repositories based on template repositories, that can
        contain for example instructions and skeleton code. Given one or more template
        repositories, generating copies of these for students or groups is a single
        command away! That is however just scratching the surface: RepoBee also has
        functionality for updating student repos (maybe you forgot something?), batch
        cloning of student repos (convenient when correcting tasks), giving students
        read-only access to other students' repos for peer review, and more at that!
        There is also a [plugin system](https://github.com/repobee/repobee-plug) in
        place that allows Python programmers to expand RepoBee in various ways, and end
        users can simply install plugins created by others. An example of such a plugin
        is [`repobee-junit4`](https://github.com/repobee/repobee-junit4), which runs
        teacher-defined JUnit4 test classes on Java code in cloned student repos.
        
        RepoBee is currently being used for the introductory courses in computer science at
        [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en/eecs). The
        courses have roughly 200 students and several thousands of repositories,
        allowing us to test RepoBee at quite a large scale.

        If you want to reference RepoBee in a paper, please cite the following paper:

        ### Feature highlights
        * Compatible with both GitHub and GitLab (both cloud and self-hosted)
        * Generate repositories for students based on template repositories
        * Batch cloning of student repositories
        * Peer review features: give students read access to other students'
          repositories to do code review. Easily revoke read access once reviews are
          done.
        * Support for group assignments (multiple students per repository)
        * Open, close and list issues for select student repositories
        * Extend RepoBee with the
          [plugin system](https://repobee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/plugins.html)
        * Very little configuration required on the GitHub/GitLab side
            - The only requirement is to have an Organization/Group with private repository
              capabilities!
        * No local configuration required
            - Although [setting a few defaults](https://repobee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html#configure-repobee-for-the-target-organization-the-config-category)
              is highly recommended
        
        ### Install
        We provide an install script that sets up an isolated and correctly configured
        environment for RepoBee. It supports macOS, Linux and Windows Subsystem for
        Linux (WSL). You can execute it directly using `curl`, with either `bash` or
        `zsh`.
        
        > **IMPORTANT:** If you use any other shell than bash or zsh, you must still
        > execute the install script with one of them.
        
        ```bash
        $ bash <(curl -s https://repobee.org/install.sh)
        ```
        
        ```bash
        $ zsh <(curl -s https://repobee.org/install.sh)
        ```
        
        #### Required software
        RepoBee requires Python 3.6+ and Git to be installed. The install script will
        complain if they are not, and point you to relevant resources. When you have
        installed the requirements, simply try the install script again.
        
        #### Tab completion
        RepoBee supports tab completion for `zsh` and `bash`. Follow the instructions
        from the install script to activate tab completion.
        
        ### Getting started
        The best way to get started with RepoBee is to head over to the
        [Docs](https://repobee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), where you (among other
        things) will find the
        [user guide](https://repobee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/userguide.html).
        It covers the use of RepoBee's varous commands by way of practical example,
        and should set you on the right path with little effort.
        
        ## Why RepoBee?
        RepoBee is being developed at KTH Royal Institute of Technology to
        help teachers and TAs administrate student repositories. It's a tool for
        teachers, by teachers, and we use it in our everyday work. All of the features
        in RepoBee are being actively used by us, and so should also be useful to other
        teachers.  For newcomers, RepoBee offers an opinionated workflow that is easy
        to adopt, while the more advanced users can utilize the plugin system to
        augment their experience. We also recognize that lock-in is a problem, and
        therefore provide compatibility with both GitHub and GitLab, with hopes of also
        expanding support to Bitbucket at some point. But what you're really looking
        for is probably what RepoBee can do, so below is a list of RepoBee's command
        categories, which should give you a rough idea of RepoBee's capabilities.
        
        ```
        repobee -h
        usage: repobee [-h] [-v] {repos,teams,issues,reviews,config,plugin,manage} ...

        ```
        
        ## Versioning
        As of December 17th 2018, RepoBee's CLI is a stable release and adheres to
        [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). The internals
        of RepoBee _do not_ adhere to this versioning, so using RepoBee as a library
        is not recommended.
        
        The plugin system will be mostly stable as of RepoBee 3.0, but there is a
        slight risk of breakage due to unforeseen problems. **If you develop a plugin,
        please get in touch so that can be taken into consideration if breaking changes
        are introduced to the plugin system**.
