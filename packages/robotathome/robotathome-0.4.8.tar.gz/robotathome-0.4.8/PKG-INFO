        The Robot-at-Home dataset (Robot@Home, paper
        [here](http://mapir.uma.es/papersrepo/2017/2017-raul-IJRR-Robot_at_home_dataset.pdf))
        is a collection of raw and processed data from five domestic settings compiled
        by a mobile robot equipped with 4 RGB-D cameras and a 2D laser scanner. Its main
        purpose is to serve as a testbed for semantic mapping algorithms through the
        categorization of objects and/or rooms.
        
        This package provides the Python API that assists in loading, parsing, and
        visualizing the annotations in Robot@Home. Please visit http://mapir.isa.uma.es/
        for more information on Robot@Home, including for the data, paper, and
        tutorials. The exact format of the annotations is also described on the
        [Robot@Home website](http://mapir.isa.uma.es/mapirwebsite/index.php/mapir-downloads/203-robot-at-home-dataset.html).
        
        In addition to this API, please [download](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4530453)
        the Robot@Home Dataset in order to run the demos and use the API (also, you'll
        be able to download it using the API).
