# Relief Visualization Toolbox in Python

![](./docs/figures/RVT_head.png)

Relief Visualization Toolbox was produced to help scientist visualize raster elevation model datasets. We have narrowed down the selection to include techniques that have proven to be effective for identification of small scale features. Default settings therefore assume working with high resolution digital elevation models, derived from airborne laser scanning missions (lidar).

Despite this, techniques are also used for different other purposes. Sky-view factor, for example, can be efficiently used in numerous studies where digital elevation model visualizations and automatic feature extraction techniques are indispensable, e.g. in geography, archeology,  geomorphology, cartography, hydrology, glaciology, forestry and disaster management. It can be used even in engineering applications, such as, predicting the availability of the GPS signal in urban areas.

Methods currently implemented are:

*   hillshading,
*   hillshading from multiple directions,
*   slope gradient,
*   simple local relief model,
*   multi-scale relief model,
*   sky illumination,
*   sky-view factor (as developed by our team),
*   anisotropic sky-view factor,
*   positive and negative openness,
*   local dominance.

For a more detailed description see references given at each method in the manual and a comparative paper describing them (e.g. Kokalj and Hesse 2017, see below).

RVT python library called rvt contains 3 modules: vis (rvt.vis), blend (rvt.blend) and default (rvt.default). Modules contains:
* vis       -   visualization functions (mentioned above), for computing visualizations;
* blend     -   blender (mixer), for blending visualizations;
* default   -   default values, class for defining default parameters with methods to compute and save visualization functions using set parameters.

For every visualization function directory also contains Python Esri raster functions for ArcGIS Pro (rvt_esri_*.py).

## Installation

### conda

You can install all required libraries and rvt-py with Anaconda environment from Anaconda cloud ([conda rvt_py](https://anaconda.org/zmigyyy/rvt_py)). To do that open Anaconda Prompt (activate conda environment) and run:

`conda install -c zmigyyy rvt_py`

### pypi

Another option is to install required libraries and rvt-py with Python Package Index, pypi ([pypi rvt-py](https://pypi.org/project/rvt-py)). To do that open command prompt (terminal) and run:

`pip install rvt-py`

This might not work, because pypi usually has problems installing gdal. To solve that first try to install gdal then run above command.

### requirements

We suggest using an Anaconda environment (easiest gdal installation) and Python 3.6 or higher. Required libraries with tested versions (could also work with other versions):

*   numpy 1.19.2
*   scipy 1.5.2
*   gdal 3.0.2


You can also clone the repository ([github rvt_py](https://github.com/EarthObservation/RVT_py)).

Library `rvt-py` can be used in Python scripts, Jupyter Notebooks and in ArcGIS Pro.
