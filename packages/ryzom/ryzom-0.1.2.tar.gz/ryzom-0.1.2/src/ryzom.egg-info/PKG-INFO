Description: # Ryzom: Replace HTML Templates with Python Components
        
        ## Why?
        
        Because while frameworks like Django claim that "templates include a restricted
        language to avoid for the HTML coder to shoot themself in the foot", the GoF on
        the other hand states that Decorator is the pattern that is most efficient for
        designing GUIs, which is actually a big part of the success encountered by
        frameworks such as React.
        
        ## What?
        
        Ryzom basically offers Python Components, with extra sauce of bleeding edge
        features such as "compiling Python code to JS", and "data binding" (DOM
        refreshes itself when data changes in the DB) if you enable websockets.
        
        ## State
        
        Currently in Beta stage, we are brushing up for a production release in an Open
        Source project for an NGO defending democracy, with an online voting platform
        secured with homomorphic encryption, basically a Django project built on top of
        microsoft/electionguard-python.
        
        It's **not** ready for general use, but should hopefully be pretty soon...
        after all, this project has been under R&D sponsored by YourLabs for years now.
        
        ## Usage
        
        See the supported usage patterns in `src/ryzom_django_example/urls.py` which
        provides commented code using supported Ryzom APIs.
        
        ## Demo
