Description: # SB412A-1-Python
        
        This package is used for human sensing with sb412a-1 on Rasberry Pi.
        
        # Installation
        To install, just run following:
        ```
        pip3 install sb412a_1
        ```
        
        # Usage
        1. Instantiate the `Sb412a_1` class with the pin number as constructor parameter.
        2. Call the `getData()` method to get the data: 1 for detection, 0 for no detection.
        
        ```
        from sb412a_1 import Sb412a_1
        import time
        
        SENSOR_PIN = 15
        instance = Sb412a_1(SENSOR_PIN)
        
        while True:
            print(instance.getData())
            time.sleep(1)
        ```
        For working example, see `example.py` (you probably need to adjust pin for your configuration).
