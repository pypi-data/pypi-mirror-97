        Sbank is a library for generating a template bank for compact binary searches
        covering a given region of mass and spin parameter space.
        The program can support all waveform approximants available in the
        lalsimulation suite. Currently implemented waveforms can be found with
        `sbank --help` and others added with only minor additions.
        
        Sbank has been developed collaboratively by a diverse group of LIGO scientists
        starting in 2012, and has been split off from the larger `lalsuite` package as
        a standalone module in 2021.
        Sbank has been used to generate template banks for the separate GstLAL, MBTA,
        PyCBC and SPIIR analysis codes.
        Sbank also offers support for generating precessing and/or higher-order mode
        template banks.
        
        The source code is open-source on GitHub and we welcome contributions from
        anyone.
