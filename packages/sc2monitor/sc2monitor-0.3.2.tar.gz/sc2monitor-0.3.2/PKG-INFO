        # sc2monitor
        Python (>=3.7) script that when executed regularly keeps track of medium amount StarCraft 2 accounts on the 1vs1 ladder
        
        ## Installation
        Install this Python 3 package via `pip` by executing `pip install sc2monitor`
        
        ## Execution
        To collect data run the following script regularly (every 5-15 minutes), e.g. via cronjob:
        ```python
        import sc2monitor
        
        sc2monitor.init(host='db-host',
                        user='db-user',
                        passwd='db-password',
                        db='db-database',
                        protocol='db-protocol',
                        apikey='your-bnet-api-key',
                        apisecret='your-bnet-api-secret')
        sc2monitor.run()
        ```
        Your API-key `your-bnet-api-key` and secret `your-bnet-api-secret` have to be created by registering an application at <https://develop.battle.net/access/> and have to be passed only once or when you want to change them. If not specified `mysql+pymysql` will be used as database protocol - other protocol options can be found at <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/dialects/>.
        
        If not executed regularly the script will try to make an educated guess for games played since the last execution.
        
        At execution a protocol will be automatically logged to the database.
        
        You can add and remove players to the monitor by passing their StarCraft 2 URL:
        ```python
        # Adding a player
        sc2monitor.add_player('https://starcraft2.com/en-gb/profile/2/1/221986')
        
        # Removing a player
        sc2monitor.remove_player('https://starcraft2.com/en-gb/profile/2/1/221986')
        ```
        
        ## Data
        The collected data (including statistics) can be accessed via the database tables.
