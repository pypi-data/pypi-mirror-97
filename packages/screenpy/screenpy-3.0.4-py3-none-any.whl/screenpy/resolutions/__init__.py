"""
Resolutions are asserted by actors to ensure the answer to their Questions
are as they expect. Ask your actors to provide resolutions by passing the
resolutions into their |Actor.should_see_the| or |Actor.should_see_that|
methods, with the questions they are resolving.

These form the second half of test assertions in Screenplay Pattern; the
first half is handled by Questions.
