        SDCFlows (*Susceptibility Distortion Correction workFlows*) is a Python library of 
        *NiPype*-based workflows to preprocess *B0* mapping data, estimate the corresponding
        fieldmap and finally correct for susceptibility distortions.
        Susceptibility-derived distortions are typically displayed by images acquired with EPI
        (echo-planar imaging) MR schemes.
        
        The library is designed to provide an easily accessible, state-of-the-art interface that is
        robust to differences in scan acquisition protocols and that requires minimal user input.
        
        This open-source neuroimaging data processing tool is being developed as a part of
        the MRI image analysis and reproducibility platform offered by
        `NiPreps <https://www.nipreps.org>`__.
