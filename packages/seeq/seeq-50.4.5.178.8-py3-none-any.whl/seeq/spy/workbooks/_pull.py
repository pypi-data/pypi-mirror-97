    """
    Pulls the definitions for each workbook specified by workbooks_df into
    memory as a list of Workbook items.

    Parameters
    ----------
    workbooks_df : {str, pd.DataFrame}
        A DataFrame containing 'ID', 'Type' and 'Workbook Type' columns that
        can be used to identify the workbooks to pull. This is usually created
        via a call to spy.workbooks.search(). Alternatively, you can supply URL
        of a Seeq Workbench worksheet as a str.

    include_referenced_workbooks : bool, default True
        If True, Analyses that are depended upon by Topics will be
        automatically included in the resulting list even if they were not part
        of the workbooks_df DataFrame.

    include_inventory : bool, default True
        If True, all items that are referenced in worksheets, journals, topics
        etc are included in the Workbook object's "inventory", along with
        anything that is scoped to the workbook.

    include_images : bool, default True
        If True, downloads all static images (not including embedded content --
        see include_rendered_content for that).

    include_rendered_content : bool, default False
        If True, any Organizer Topics pulled will include rendered content
        images, which will cause spy.workbooks.save() to include a folder for
        each Topic Document with its HTML and images such that it can be loaded
        and viewed in a browser.

    specific_worksheet_ids : List[str], default None
        If supplied, only the worksheets with IDs specified in the supplied
        list will be pulled. This should be used when it would otherwise take
        too long to pull all worksheets and you're only interested in a small
        subset. Be careful not to push the resulting workbook(s) back because
        the other worksheets will get archived.

    errors : {'raise', 'catalog'}, default 'raise'
        If 'raise', any errors encountered will cause an exception. If
        'catalog', errors will be added to a 'Result' column in the status.df
        DataFrame (errors='catalog' must be combined with
        status=<Status object>).

    quiet : bool
        If True, suppresses progress output.

    status : spy.Status, optional
        If specified, the supplied Status object will be updated as the command
        progresses. It gets filled in with the same information you would see
        in Jupyter in the blue/green/red table below your code while the
        command is executed. The table itself is accessible as a DataFrame via
        the status.df property.
