The **seeq** Python module is used to interface with Seeq Server ([http://www.seeq.com](http://www.seeq.com)).

**IMPORTANT:**

This module does **NOT** follow semantic versioning.

The **Seeq** Python module's version number is of the form `a.b.c.F.G`. For example, `0.46.0.178.00`.

**For Seeq Python versions before 178**, the minor version _G_ is not used. For example, `0.46.0.118`

**For Seeq Server version R22**, the Seeq Server version is of the form `R22.a.bb.cc`. 
For example, `R22.0.47.02`. 

**For Seeq Server versions R50 and later**, the Seeq Server version is of the form `Raa.b.c`.
For example `R51.2.0`.

You must use particular PIP commands to install a version of the **seeq** Python module that is compatible
with the version of Seeq Server you are using.

Here are some examples.

| Seeq Server Version | PIP Install Command |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| R22.0.46.00 | `pip install -U seeq~=0.46.0` |
| R22.0.47.02 | `pip install -U seeq~=0.47.2` |
| R50.0.0 | `pip install -U seeq~=50.0` |
| R51.2.1 | `pip install -U seeq~=51.2` |

**Note how the commands for R50 and later only utilize the `a` and `b` part of the Seeq Server version,
while R22 commands must utilize `a`, `b` and `c`.**

The last part of the version of this `seeq` module (the _F.G_ of a.b.c.F.G) is referred to as the
_functional version_ and refers to the level of functionality (and bug fixes) present in the package
for the SPy module (with _F_ and _G_ being the major and minor SPy versions, respectively).
For example,`0.47.0.178.01` and `50.2.1.178.01` have the same level of SPy functionality
but are built for the respective versions of Seeq Server (R22.0.47.00 and R50.2.1).

In order to keep the SPy testing and compatibility matrix manageable, the latest functional versions (v175+) are
published only for Seeq Server R22.0.49.xx and higher.  

# seeq.spy

The Seeq **SPy** module is a friendly set of functions that are optimized for use with
[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org/).

The SPy module is the best choice if you're trying to do any of the following:

- Search for signals, conditions, scalars, assets
- Pull data out of Seeq
- Import data in a programmatic way (when Seeq Workbench's *CSV Import* capability won't cut it)
- Calculate new data in Python and push it into Seeq
- Create an asset model

**Use of the SPy module requires Python 3.7 or later.**

To start exploring the SPy module, execute the following lines of code in Jupyter:

```
from seeq import spy
spy.docs.copy()
```

Your Jupyter folder will now contain a `SPy Documentation` folder that has a *Tutorial* and *Command Reference*
notebook that will walk you through common activities.

For more advanced tasks, you may need to use the SDK module described below.

# seeq.sdk

The Seeq **SDK** module is a set of Python bindings for the Seeq Server REST API. You can experiment with the
REST API by selecting the *API Reference* menu item in the upper-right "hamburger" menu of Seeq Workbench.

**The SDK module supports both Python 2.x and Python 3.x, but it is strongly recommended that you use Python 3.x
(or later) as Python 2.x is end-of-life.**

Login is accomplished with the following pattern:

```
import seeq
import getpass

api_client = seeq.sdk.ApiClient('http://localhost:34216/api')

# Change this to False if you're getting errors related to SSL
seeq.sdk.Configuration().verify_ssl = True

auth_api = seeq.sdk.AuthApi(api_client)
auth_input = seeq.sdk.AuthInputV1()

# Use raw_input() instead of input() if you're using Python 2
auth_input.username = input('Username:').rstrip().lower()
auth_input.password = getpass.getpass()
auth_input.auth_provider_class = "Auth"
auth_input.auth_provider_id = "Seeq"
auth_api.login(body=auth_input)
```

The `api_client` object is then used as the argument to construct any API object you need, such as
`seeq.sdk.ItemsApi`. Each of the root endpoints that you see in the *API Reference* webpage corresponds
to a `seeq.sdk.XxxxxApi` class.

# Upgrade Considerations

## 0.49.XX.XXX

In Seeq Server R22.0.49.00, the ability to schedule the update of an Organizer Topic was added. As
a result, much of the internals of how Organizer Topic embedded content and date ranges are represented
changed.

If you have used `spy.workbooks.save()` in R22.0.48.XX and earlier to save a set of Organizer Topic
workbooks to disk, you will not be able to use those files in R22.0.49.00 and later.

Live Docs must now be specified by a `schedule` on the `TopicDocument` object. The `@Asset.DateRange`
decorator no longer honors the `Auto Refresh Rate` property. To specify a Live Doc, you must specify a
`schedule` dict for a TopicDocument by setting `document.schedule['Background'] = False` and then
specifying a Cron expression like `schedule['Cron Schedule'] = ['*/30 * * * * *']` (every thirty seconds).
Alternatively, you can specify a Scheduled Doc by setting `document.schedule['Background'] = True`.
