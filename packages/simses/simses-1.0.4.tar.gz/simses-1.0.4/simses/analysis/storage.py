class StorageAnalysis:

    """
    StorageAnalysis conducts the analysis of the simulated storage systems by SimSES. For each storage technology as
    well as for each (sub)system key performance indicators (KPI) are generated and time series are plotted. All
    information is merged into a HTML file which opens in the standard browser after analysis is finished. The analysis
    is configured by analysis.ini in the config package. Additionally, KPIs for comparison between multiple simulations
    are written to file in batch folder located in results path.
