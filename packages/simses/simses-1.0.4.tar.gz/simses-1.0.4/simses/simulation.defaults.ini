;           and keeps SOC as low as possible in order to reduce calendar aging.
;           MAX_POWER: This value determines the peak-shaving limit

;           POWER_FCR: How much power should be offered to the FCR market?
;           SOC_SET: Target SOC for FCR simulations
;           FCR_RESERVE: Full power reserve for alert state in h, default: 0.25 (15 minute criterion)

;   MIN_SOC in p.u [0,1[ and MAX_SOC in p.u ]0,1]: Lower SOC limit and upper SOC limit of the storage system.
;       For IntradayMarketRecharge to determine the SOC range at which it is necessary to charge
;       or discharge the storage system. Set to different values if the SOC range of the technology differs from [0;1].
