Changelog
=========

8.4 (2021-03-06)
----------------
* Made the :ref:`image writer component <imageWriter>` pluggable
* Added support for defining groups of entries (via the :ref:`entryGroups`
  section of the ref file) whose disassembly pages can be given custom titles
  and headers

  specifying the format of address fields on disassembly pages and memory map
  pages, and of the default link text for the :ref:`R` macro)
* Added the ``Length`` parameter to the :ref:`ref-Game` section (for specifying
  the format of the new ``length`` attribute of entry objects in
  :ref:`htmlTemplates`, which is now used instead of ``size`` in the Length
  column on :ref:`memory map pages <memoryMap>`)

  when it appears in a BASIC program

  :ref:`UDGARRAY` macros (for specifying the alpha value to use for the
  transparent colour)
