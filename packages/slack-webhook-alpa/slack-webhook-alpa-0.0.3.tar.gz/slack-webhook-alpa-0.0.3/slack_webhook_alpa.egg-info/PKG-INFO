Description: # slack_webhook
        
        This is a simple wrapper over the slack_sdk for sending messages into a specific
        slack channel.
        
        ## Prerequisite
        
        In order to send messages using incoming webhook into slack, an Application
        must be configured. This needs to be done from a slack account with
        administrator rights.  This is done on a per slack channel basis.
        
        Request an incoming webhook from the administrator with the name of an
        existing channel for receiving the alerts.
        
        An unique URL will be generated by the administrator.
        
        Note that there is no authentication mechanism.  Anyone (script) with
        knowledge of this URL will be able to generate messages into this channel.
        
        Following is a (fake) sample of such an URL:
        
        ```
        https://hooks.slack.com/services/T02TQT999/B01PZ5XXXXX/GevkYac4s55lE97fXXXXXXX
        ```
        
        ## Installation
        ```
        pip install slack-webhook-alpa
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```
        from slack_webhook import SlackWebhook, SlackWebhookException
        
        url = 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
        
        slack_alert = SlackWebhook(url)
        slack_alert.send('TEST TEST TEST')
        ```
        
        ## TODO
        - support for fancy formatting of message
