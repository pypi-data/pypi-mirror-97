Description: # sopel-dns
        
        A DNS lookup plugin for Sopel IRC bots
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        Basic usage performs an 'A' record lookup:
        
        ```
        <user> .dns domain.tld
        <bot>  user: 10.10.0.1
        ```
        
        To look up IPv6 addresses instead, specify the 'AAAA' record type:
        
        ```
        <user> .dns domain.tld AAAA
        <bot>  user: fd12:3456:789a:1::1
        ```
        
        Other [supported record types](#supported-dns-record-types) output their
        results in a similar fashion. Some types, such as `MX` and `TXT`, split the
        output across multiple lines to make it easier to read, at the cost of
        possible "spam" if there are many records attached to the queried domain.
        
        ### Rate limiting
        
        Normal users are rate-limited to one `.dns` command every 5 minutes, both to
        control channel flood and to prevent hammering whatever DNS server Sopel's
        host system uses to resolve the submitted queries.
        
        
        ## Supported DNS record types
        
        * `A`
        * `AAAA`
        * `CNAME`
        * `MX`
        * `NS`
        * `PTR`
        * `TXT`
        
        If a record type you want isn't listed here, feel free to request it in an
        [issue](https://github.com/dgw/sopel-dns/issues/new). Even better: a pull
        request enabling that record type, including a demo of the resulting output.
