Version 0.3.0
=============

Added `[dns]` output prefix. This also meant changing most of the plugin's
output from replies to normal "say", which is fine. The flood of HLs from
looking up stuff like `MX` or `TXT` records could get annoying.

Rate limit has been reduced from 5 minutes to 2 minutes.


Version 0.2.1
=============

Fixed error when a DNS query has no answer (no results).


Version 0.2.0
=============

Added support for choosing DNS record type to look up. Currently understands
`A`, `AAAA`, `CNAME`, `MX`, `NS`, `PTR` (for IP addresses only), and `TXT`.


Version 0.1.0
=============

Initial release with support for querying a domain's `A` records.
