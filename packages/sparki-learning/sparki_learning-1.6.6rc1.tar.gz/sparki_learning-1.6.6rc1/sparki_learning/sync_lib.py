#
# This module defines functions to synchronize two or more machines using sockets
# One machine is defined by the programmer to be the server. The rest of the machines
# are defined as clients. The programmer would call start_sync_client(SERVER_IP) on each of the client
# machines. All client machines would then return from that function at nearly the same
# time.
#
# For example, to make several computers beep at approximately the same time, write on
# each client:
# start_sync_client(SERVER_IP, SERVER_PORT)
# beep()
#
# The server listens for all of the clients to connect and gives each one the start time. Once the 
# start time passes, the server resumes executing its own program.  Note that you may have to open 
# the firewall on the server for PORT
#
# To have the server join the beeping above, you'd write:
# start_sync_server(wait_time)
# beep()

    # The server then sends the time to start the event and both server and client close the socket
