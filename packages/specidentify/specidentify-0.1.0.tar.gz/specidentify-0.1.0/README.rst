Contributing
-------------

All contributions to specidentify are very welcome!   

This repository is based on work that I initially produced over 10 years ago. While I still have some use for it, this is now maintained
as a hobby and not part of my full time job.  As such, my ability to respond may be very limited, but any contributions are very much 
appreciated and welcomed!   

These can be in the form of feedback (please open an issue to let me know what you think), pull requests (please feel free to improve or add to 
the repository), citing it if you do find it useful, or sharing it if it might be of help to others.   

Also please feel free to reach out to me via  email_ or twitter_ !

Specidentify follows the `Astropy Code of Conduct`_ and strives to provide a
welcoming community to all of our users and contributors.

Documentation
-------------

A notebook_ is provided with an example of 
calibrating a 1D spectrum using the interactive `ArcIdentify` class.  

An earlier version of the package is demostrated in the `iraf notebook`_ 
showing how to use specidentify on IRAF data.  Unfortunately, the link to the data that the 
notebook was based on is no longer available.  If you might know where a public version of that data are, please let me know.
