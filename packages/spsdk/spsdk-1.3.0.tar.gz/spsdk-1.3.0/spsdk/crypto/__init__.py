"""Module for crypto operations (certificate and key management).

Moreover, it includes SignatureProvider as an Interface for all potential signature providers.

It provides following functionality:

1. for the key management:

- generating RSA private key (size and exponent as parameter)
- generating RSA public key
- saving RSA private key to the file
- saving RSA public key to the file
- generating ECC private key (curve name as parameter)
- generating ECC public key
- saving ECC private key to the file
- saving ECC public key to the file

2. for certificate management:

- generating the x.509 certificate
- validating of a certificate
- validating of a chain of certificates
- returning public key from the given certificate
- converting a certificate into bytes
- saving a certificate into file

3. for general purpose:

- loading the public key from file
- loading the private key from file
- loading the x.509 certificate from file
