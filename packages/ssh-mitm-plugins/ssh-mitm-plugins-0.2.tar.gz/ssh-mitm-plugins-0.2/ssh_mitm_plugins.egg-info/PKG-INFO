Description: # SSH-MITM Plugins
        
        ![SSH-MITM example](https://ssh-mitm.at/img/mitm-example.png)
        
        With version 0.4.0 the [ssh-mitm projects](http://ssh-mitm.at/) locks the features
        shipping with the core functionality of the program. It is now preferred that any additions to the
        feature-set is made through the modular capabilities that the ssh-mitm project is built upon. Using
        entrypoints in combination with modules anyone can make their own ssh-mitm plugins.
        
        This projects adds some advanced features to the ssh-mitm server that furthers its capabilities
        to realise security audits.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Installing the ssh-mitm server including these plugins is very simple:
        
            $ pip install ssh-mitm-plugins
            
        The current version of the ssh-mitm server will be installed and additional advanced features
        will be available through these plugins. The ssh-mitm server will operate normally as described
        by the [ssh-mitm project](#ssh-mitm).
        
        ## Plugins
        
        Following advanced features will be made available through the modular runtime compilation of 
        the ssh-mitm server.
        
        #### SSH 
        * stealthshell - improving on the *injectorshell*, this ssh interface will
        make hijacking of a ssh session undetectable
        * scriptedshell - perfect for security audits and information gathering, this ssh interface executes
        a script on the remote machine and stores the output on the ssh-mitm server
        
        For a more detailed look at the plugins usage and operation refer to the 
        [documentation](http://ssh-mitm-plugins.readthedocs.io).
