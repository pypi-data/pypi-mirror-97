- Purify DNA via phenol-chloroform extraction:

  - Dilute or divide your sample as necessary to 
    ensure that each tube has between 100-700 µL [1].

  - Repeat twice:

    - Add an equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl
      alcohol (pH≈8 for DNA) to the tube.

    - Vortex vigorously to mix the phases.
     
    - Spin in a microfuge at top speed for 1-2 min to 
      separate the phases.
     
    - Transfer the aqueous (upper) phase to a new tube, 
      being careful not to transfer any of the protein 
      at the phase interface.
   
  - Extract the sample with an equal volume of 
    chloroform:isoamyl alcohol to remove the phenol.

Footnotes:

[1] It is difficult to do the extraction with volumes 
    smaller than 100 µL. The sample can be 
    concentrated again after precipitation.
