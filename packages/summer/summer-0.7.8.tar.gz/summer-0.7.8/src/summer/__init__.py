"""Summer is light weight *Python* framework to support some common tasks
in variety of applications.  It tries to assist you with:

* Managing objects that implement your business logic.

* Using SQL transactions by simply decorating methods as `@transactional`.

* Using LDAP sessions by simply decorating methods as `@ldapaop`.

* Using gettext for localization.

With summer you can:

* Create and configure your stateless objects and deploy them into a simple
  container to be ready for any later use.

* Declaratively create transaction proxies or programmatically manage
  transactions.

* Declaratively create ldap proxies or programmatically manage ldap sessions.

* Get gettext l10n configured fast and ready to use.

Reasons to name it summer:

* I wrote it in winter.

* You may know Java based *spring* framework, which was my inspiration.

Summer's top level module simply imports public API classes and methods
into `summer` namespace.
