    The ``get_system``, ``get_manager`` and ``get_chassis`` methods modified
    not to require the ``identity`` parameter referring to a particular
    resource instance. If ``identity`` is omited, sushy will default to the
    only available resource for as long as it's single and therefore
    deterministic.
    The intent is to simplify user API by not requiring the consumer to
    discover available resources prior to requesting one.
