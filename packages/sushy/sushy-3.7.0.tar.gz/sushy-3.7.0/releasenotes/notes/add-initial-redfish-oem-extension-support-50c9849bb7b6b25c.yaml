    Adds foundation for supporting resource extensibility proposed as
    OEM extensibility in Redfish specification [1] to the library.

      * Provides an attribute 'oem_vendors' in Resource classes to
        discover the available OEM extensions.
      * Provides a method 'get_oem_extension()' in Resource classes
        to get the vendor defined resource OEM extension object, if
        discovered.
