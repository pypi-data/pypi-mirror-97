    Adds the ability to conditionally match sushy fields against received JSON
    object. The conditional matching is performed by a user-supplied callable
    which gets the key to consider (along with the value and potentially other
    details) and should indicate the the caller if the match occurred.
    The motivation behind this change is to accommodate malformed Redfish
    resource properties as observed in the OEM wilderness.
