deprecations:
  - |
    The ``supported_values`` property in the
    ``OperationApplyTimeSupportField`` class is deprecated. Use the
    ``mapped_supported_values`` property instead. The
    ``mapped_supported_values`` property uses the ``MappedListField`` type
    to map the Redfish schema-defined enumeration values to constants exposed
    by the Sushy package.
features:
  - |
    Update the ``create_volume`` method in the ``VolumeCollection`` class and
    the ``delete_volume`` and ``initialize_volume`` methods in the ``Volume``
    class to take optional ``apply_time`` and ``timeout`` keyword parameters.
    This allows the caller of those volume methods to specify a preferred
    ``OperationApplyTime`` annotation and a maximum timeout for synchronous
    operations. For asynchronous operations, those three methods will now
    return a ``TaskMonitor`` instance that the caller can use to monitor the
    state of the task.
