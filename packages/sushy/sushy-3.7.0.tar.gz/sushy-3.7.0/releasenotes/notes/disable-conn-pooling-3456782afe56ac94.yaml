    Disable HTTP connection pooling by asking HTTP server to close our
    connection right upon use. The rationale is that some BMC observed in
    the wild seem to close persistent connections abruptly upon eventual
    re-use failing completely unrelated operation. So in ``sushy`` we
    just try not to maintain persistent connections with BMC at all.
