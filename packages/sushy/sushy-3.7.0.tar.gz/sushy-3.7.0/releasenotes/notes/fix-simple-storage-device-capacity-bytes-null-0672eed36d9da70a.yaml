    Fixes bug in ``SimpleStorageCollection.disks_sizes_bytes`` which assumed
    the type of a disk's ``CapacityBytes`` property is ``integer``. According
    to the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) Redfish standard schema
    [1], it can be ``null``, which is converted to ``None`` in Python. For
    more information, see `story 2006918
    <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2006918>`_.
