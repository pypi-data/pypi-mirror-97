    Fixes issues in the ``volume`` module where the first parameter passed to
    the ``TaskMonitor`` constructor was incorrect. The parameter passed was
    the resource object (self), but it should have been the connector object
    (self._conn). This affected the ``create_volume()`` and
    ``delete_volume()`` methods.
