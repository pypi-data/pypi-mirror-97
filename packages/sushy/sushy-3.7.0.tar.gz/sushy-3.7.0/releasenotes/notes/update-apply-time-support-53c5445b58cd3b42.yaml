features:
  - |
    Update sushy models to support the Redfish SettingsApplyTime and
    OperationApplyTimeSupport annotations.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``operation_apply_time_support`` and ``maintenance_window``
    properties in the ``SettingsField`` class are deprecated. The
    ``SettingsField`` class represents the ``@Redfish.Settings``
    annotation and those properties cannot appear within this
    annotation. Instead use the ``apply_time_settings`` property
    in the target resource (e.g. ``Bios`` resource).
