        #### Minimum fully-supported Tasmota firmware version: [6.6.0.17](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/blob/development/tasmota/CHANGELOG.md#66017-20191009)
        
        #### To the users:
        I'm very grateful for all your support over the months, ideas, and donations, and most of all: patience.
        While I'm not in any way abandoning this project, I don't have as much time as I'd like to work on it. If anything, keep being patient as new features will come, but I'm not at liberty of setting any deadlines or plans.
