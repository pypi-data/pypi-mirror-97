import teachmedijkstra.DirectedGraph

class UndirectedGraph(teachmedijkstra.DirectedGraph):
    r"""
    Represents an undirected weighted graph.

    This class implements some basic methods to work with an undirected graph
    and, most of all, methods to draw the graph either using the TikZ library
    or the PSTricks library of LaTeX.

    Definition:
        An *undirected weighted graph* consists of:

          * V ... a set of vertices,
          * E ... a set of edges,
          * p: E -> {{a,b} | a,b in V} ... an *incidence function* that maps
              each edge to an unordered pair of vertices,
          * w: E -> R ... a *weight function* that maps each edge to a positive
              real number.

    An undirected graph, represented by this class, is basically a directed
    graph represented by `teachmedijkstra.DirectedGraph` where each edge (a, b) with weight w
    has its counterpart (b, a) with the same weight w.
    See the method `UndirectedGraph.addEdge`.

        Adds a new undirected edge to the graph.

        This, actually, consists in adding two directed edges:
        (initial, terminal) and (terminal, initial).

        already present in the graph, nothing is created.
