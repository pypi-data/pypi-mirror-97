class Dijkstra:
    """
    Implements the Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest paths in a
    directed or undirected graph.

    Apart from the computation of the shortest paths, the class is also able to
    export the shortest path tree (shortest path covering) as a TikZ image and
    to export, in a LaTeX table, the values assigned to the graph vertices in
    each individual step of the algorithm.

    Attributes:
        graph (teachmedijkstra.DirectedGraph or teachmedijkstra.UndirectedGraph): the processed graph
        startingVertex (str): the name of the vertex from which the shortest
            paths are to be found
        table (dict of list of dict): contains the data to export the LaTeX table
            with the information about the progress of the algorithm run;
            see `Dijkstra.exportTableToLaTeX`.
            One dimension of the table corresponds to the vertices of the graph
            and the second one corresponds to the time steps of the algorithm
            run.
            The keys of the `dict` are names of the vertices of the processed
            graph and the values are `list` of time steps.
            Each item in the list is a `dict` with the keys:

            * `"predecessor"`: predecessor of the vertex on the shortest path
                found so far
            * `"distance"`: length of the shortest path found so far
            * `"closed"`: `True` if all the successors of the vertex have
                already been visited
            * `"overwritten"`: `True` if `distance` has been overwritten in
                this step

        closed (dict of bool): The keys are the names of the vertices of the
            processed graph and the values are either `True` or `False` indicating
            whether the vertex has been already processed by the algorithm
        numOverwrites (int): how many times (totally, during the algorithm run)
            has been the value `distance` of a vertex overwritten by a smaller
            value;
            If graphs are randomly generated for a purpose of examen tests,
            this can serve as an indicator of the complexity of the test.
        maxOverwrites (int): the maximal possible value of `numOverwrites`;
            computed according to the number of the vertices and the number of
            the edges of the graph
        shortestPathTree (set of 2-tuples): set of pairs of vertices describing
            the edges that belong to the shortest path tree (shortest path
            covering)
