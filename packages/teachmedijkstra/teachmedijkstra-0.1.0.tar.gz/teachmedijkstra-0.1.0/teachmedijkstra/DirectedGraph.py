Definition of class `DirectedGraph` which represents a directed weighted graph.
"""

__all__ = ["DirectedGraph"]

class DirectedGraph:
    r"""
    Represents a directed weighted graph.

    This class implements some basic methods to work with a directed graph and,
    most of all, methods to draw the graph either using the TikZ library or the
    PSTricks library of LaTeX.

    Definition:
        A *directed weighted graph* consists of:

          * V ... a set of vertices,
          * E ... a set of edges,
          * p: E -> V x V ... an *incidence function* that maps each edge to an
              ordered pair of vertices,
          * w: E -> R ... a *weight function* that maps each edge to a positive
              real number.

    Example:
        The following code creates a directed graph with 6 vertices and 8 edges
        and exports it to a LaTeX document as a TikZ image.
        Notice that additional TikZ options can be attached to the definition
        of an edge.

            import teachmedijkstra.DirectedGraph

            graph = teachmedijkstra.DirectedGraph()
            graph.addVertex("a", (0, 1))
            graph.addVertex("b", (1, 1))
            graph.addVertex("c", (2, 1))
            graph.addVertex("d", (0, 0))
            graph.addVertex("e", (1, 0))
            graph.addVertex("f", (2, 0))
            graph.addEdge("a", "b", 5)
            graph.addEdge("b", "c", 3)
            graph.addEdge("d", "e", 4)

    Attributes:
        vertices (dict of 2-tuples of int): the key of each item is a string
            which represents the name of the vertex;
            the tuple `(x, y)` is the position of the vertex (needed when the
            graph is drawn utilizing TikZ or PSTricks)
        edges (dict of dict of float): dict with two keys;
            the first key is a string that represents the name of the first
            vertex of the directed edge;
            analogously, the second key represents the second vertex;
            the value is the weight of the edge;
            if an edge does not exist then the corresponding pair of keys is
            not present in the dict
        edgesOptions (dict of dict of str): dict with the same key structure as
            `edges`, however, the values contain strings with additional TikZ
            options for each edge
