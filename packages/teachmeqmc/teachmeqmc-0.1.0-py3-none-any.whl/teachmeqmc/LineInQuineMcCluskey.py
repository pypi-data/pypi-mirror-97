    """
    Implements a line that represents a term, or merged terms, in the
        first phase of the Quine-McCluskey algorithm (when it is finding prime
        implicants).

    Attributes:
        identifier (list of int): It is a list of non-negative integers which
                denote the original (initial) terms from which this term has been
                created by merging.
            In the beginning, each line (i.e. term) has a unique integer
                assigned.
            Further, when two lines are merged, the identifier of the resulting
                line is the union of the identifiers of the two original lines.
            For example, lines
                [5] (1, 0, 0)
                and
                [7] (1, 1, 0)
                are merged to
                [5, 7] (1, 2, 0).
        term (tuple of int): The integer values in the tuple are from the set
            {0, 1, 2};

            * **0** stands for logical zero ("non-truth"),
            * **1** stands for logical unit ("truth"),
            * **2** stands for undetermined value (if the values of two original
                lines were, on this particular position, both "truth" and
                "non-truth"; see also the example ebove).
        used (bool): Denotes whether this line has been merged with another
                line.
            If it is `False` then the term corresponding to this line may
            appear in the resulting minimized DNF (disjunctive normal form).
        removed (bool): If `True` then this line has been removed from the list
                since another identical line is already present.
            Such a line could be deleted directly, however, this allows to make
                this removed line visible in the resulting LeTeX output.
        undetermined ... text in LaTeX format
            Represents the symbols which is used to denote the undetermined
                (don't care) value in a line of a step of the Quine-McCluskey
                algorithm.
            It corresponds with the value `2` in the description of the
                attribute `term`.
            It is '\\text{-}' by default and it can be changed if another
                symbol is preferred.
