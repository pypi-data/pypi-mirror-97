5,"association rule learning","association rule learning is a method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. it is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using different measures of interestingness. based on the concept of strong rules, rakesh agrawal et al.[2] introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (pos) systems in supermarkets. for example, the rule {onions, potatoes}=>{burger} found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat."
4,"cluster analysis","cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense or another) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). it is a main task of exploratory data mining, and a common technique for statistical data analysis, used in many fields, including machine learning, pattern recognition, image analysis, information retrieval, and bioinformatics. cluster analysis itself is not one specific algorithm, but the general task to be solved. it can be achieved by various algorithms that differ significantly in their notion of what constitutes a cluster and how to efficiently find them.

3,"logistic regression","logistic regression was developed by statistician david cox in 1958[2][3](although much work was done in the single independent variable case almost two decades earlier). the binary logistic model is used to estimate the probability of a binary response based on one or more predictor (or independent) variables (features). as such it is not a classification method. it could be called a qualitative response/discrete choice model in the terminology of economics."
1,"decision trees","decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model which maps observations about an item to conclusions about the items target value. it is one of the predictive modelling approaches used in statistics, data mining and machine learning. tree models where the target variable can take a finite set of values are called classification trees. in these tree structures, leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees."
2,"simple regression","in statistics, simple linear regression is the least squares estimator of a linear regression model with a single explanatory variable. in other words, simple linear regression fits a straight line through the set of n points in such a way that makes the sum of squared residuals of the model (that is, vertical distances between the points of the data set and the fitted line) as small as possible."
