Description: # timeguard-supplymaster-python
        
        This Python module will provides an open-source implementation of the client API used by the Timeguard's Supplymaster application. This is typically used to control [Timeguard's FSTWIFI Wi-Fi Controlled Fused Spur](https://www.timeguard.com/products/time/immersion-and-general-purpose-timeswitches/wi-fi-controlled-fused-spur)
        
        This implementation is based on my [investigation of the API](https://github.com/rjpearce/timeguard-supplymaster)
        
        It is currently in the early stages of development, contributions are always welcome but it will be a fast moving target
