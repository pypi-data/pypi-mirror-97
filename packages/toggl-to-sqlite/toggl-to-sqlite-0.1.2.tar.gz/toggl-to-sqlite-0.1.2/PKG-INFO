Description: # toggl-to-sqlite
        
        Create a SQLite database containing data from your [Toggl](https://toggl.com/) account.
        
        ## How to install
        
            $ pip install toggl-to-sqlite
        
        ## Usage
        
        You will need to first obtain a valid OAuth token for your toggl account. You can do this by running the `auth` command and following the prompts:
        
            $ toggl-to-sqlite auth
            You will need to get your API Token from this page
        
            https://track.toggl.com/profile...
        
            Once you have your API Token enter it at the command line. 
            
            Authentication tokens written to auth.json
        
        Now you can fetch all of your items from toggl like this:
        
            $ toggl-to-sqlite fetch toggl.db
        
        The first time you run this command it will fetch all of your items, and display a progress bar while it does it.
        
        ## Using with Datasette
        
        The SQLite database produced by this tool is designed to be browsed using [Datasette](https://datasette.readthedocs.io/). Use the [datasette-render-timestamps](https://github.com/simonw/datasette-render-timestamps) plugin to improve the display of the timestamp values.
