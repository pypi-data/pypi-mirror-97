## Issues and Usage Q&A

To ask questions, report issues or request features, please use the [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/stanfordnlp/issues).

## Setup

StanfordNLP supports Python 3.6 or later. We strongly recommend that you install PACKAGENAME from PyPI. If you already have [pip installed](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/), simply run:
```bash
pip3 install tomsup
```

Or to install it from github run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KennethEnevoldsen/tomsup.git
cd tomsup
pip3 install -e .
```

## Getting Started with PACKAGENAME

```python
>>> import tomsup
>>> 
```

The output should look something like:

```
('Barack', '200000', 'sampleoutput')
```

**Note:** There is probably things you would want to write a note on.


See [our getting started guide](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanfordnlp/installation_usage.html#getting-started) for more details.

### A todolist:

Need to have
- rework of WSLS

Nice to have:
- Smart initialize ToM
- reinforcement learner agent
