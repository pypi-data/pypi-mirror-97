        An implementation of game theory of mind in an agent based framework following the implementation of [Devaine, et al. (2017)](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005833). This package also includes a theory of mind.

        ## üîß Setup and installation
        
        tomsup supports Python 3.6 or later. We strongly recommend that you install tomsup from pip. If you haven't installed pip you can install it from [the official pip website](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/), otherwise simply run 
        
        (**the version on pip isn't currently up to date**)
        ```bash
        pip3 install tomsup 
        ```
        
        You can also install it directly from github by simply running:
        ```bash
        pip install git+https://github.com/KennethEnevoldsen/tomsup.git
        ```
        
        or more explicitly:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/KennethEnevoldsen/tomsup.git
        cd tomsup
        pip3 install -e .
        ```
        ## Getting Started with tomsup
        To get started with tomsup we recommend the tutorials in the tutorials folder. We recommend that you start with the introduction.
        
        The tutorials are provided as Jupyter Notebooks. If you do not have Jupyter Notebook installed, instructions for installing and running can be found [here]( http://jupyter.org/install). 
        
        Currently we have the following tutorials
        - introduction, a general introduction to the features of tomsup
        - Creating_an_agent, an example of how you would create new agent for the package. 
        - introduction_to_tom, an introduction to the variational bayes theory of mind model used in tomsup. (**Not currently finished**)
        
        There is also an example psychopy experiment, in which the player can play against the theory of mind agent in the matching pennies task. (**currently not finished**)
