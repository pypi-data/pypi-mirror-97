Description: # tues
        
        Easily run commands on collections of hosts
        
        ## Install
        
         * Clone the repository
         * Run `python setup.py install` or `python setup.py develop` in a virtualenv
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        Tues expects a command to execute, followed by the name of a hostname provider and its arguments.
        
        Execute on all hosts in file hostnames.
        
        ```
        echo "localhost" > hostnames
        tues "ls" file hostnames
        ```
        
        ## Providers
        
        ### Foreman
        
        Execute on all hosts matching a certain foreman expression.
        
        ```
        export FOREMAN_URL="https://user:password@foreman.domain/"
        tues "ls" fm "class = my::class"
        ```
        
        ### Custom Providers
        
        New providers may be added by putting a new executable with a name like "tues-provider-<name>"
        on your PATH. A provider is expected to return a newline seperated list of hosts.
        
        If the provider returns with an error, the output is considered to be an error message and/or
        it's help output. If '--help' is passed through to the provider the output is displayed no matter
        what exit code is used.
