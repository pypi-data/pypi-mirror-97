Introduction
============
Thanks for considering contributing to udocker.
Contributions to udocker are welcome. 
You can contribute by improving the documentation, submit bug reports,
provide feature requests, or writing code for udocker its installation
and testing.

Ground Rules
============
We aim at having portability, udocker is meant to be executed both
on older distributions (such as CentOS 6) and newer, so beware of
which python features you use and whether they are supported in
older distributions.

The current Python 2 version of udocker is meant to be very easily moved 
between hosts, and submitted to batch systems, that's why we have everything 
in a single Python script.

Development work on a Python 3 version is ongoing in branch devel3
This version supports Python 2 and Python 3 and is modular.
