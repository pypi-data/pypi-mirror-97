        =============
        
        I've run into enough cases where I want to get the exact equivalent of `PHP's
        uniqid function`_.
        
        One snippet I found on the internet, `here`_, had imperfections, and appeared
        to be slow. This was probably due to the fact that it did not actually
        follow the implementation PHP used. So, I created this.
