Description: # Vorta Backup Client <img alt="Logo" src="https://files.qmax.us/vorta/vorta-512px.png" align="right" height="50">
        
        Vorta is a backup client for macOS and Linux desktops. It integrates the mighty [BorgBackup](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io) with your desktop environment to protect your data from disk failure, ransomware and theft.

        ## Why is this great? ðŸ¤©
        
        - **Encrypted, deduplicated and compressed backups** using [Borg](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io) as backend.
        - **No vendor lock-in** â€“Â back up to local drives, your own server or [BorgBase](https://www.borgbase.com), a hosting service for Borg backups.
        - **Open source** â€“Â free to use, modify, improve and audit.
        - **Flexible profiles** to group source folders, backup destinations and schedules.
        - **One place** to view all point-in-time archives and restore individual files.
