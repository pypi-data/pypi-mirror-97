        ## Overview
        This project is an addendum to the vRealize Build Tools and Developer Tools. 
        
        This project parses scriptable tasks out of Workflow XML, saves them as descrete files for editing and SCC, and imports edits in code back into XML for inclusion in vRO Package updates.
        ## Setup
        
        Right now, the library is not hosted on **PyPi** so you will need to do a local
        install on your system if you plan to use it in other scrips you use.
        
        First, clone this repo to your local system. After you clone the repo, make sure
        to run the `setup.py` file, so you can install any dependencies you may need. To
        run the `setup.py` file, run the following command in your terminal.
        
        ```console
        pip install -e .
        ```
        
        This will install all the dependencies listed in the `setup.py` file. Once done
        you can use the library wherever you want.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Here is a simple example of using the `vroParse` library to grab the index
        files for specific quarter.
        
        ```python
        ```
