"""Check web (or commands) for changes and notify

webchanges checks web content (or the output of local commands) for changes and shows or notifies you via e-mail or
one of many other supported services if any change is detected; the notification includes the changed URL (or command)
and a 'diff' summary of the changes. You can fine-tune what to track by using filters.
