Description: # xdg-binary-cache
        
        This is a simple library that is used to download a pre-compiled binary
        into the `$XDG_CACHE` directory. The library is meant to be used by
        [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hooks that I've authored.
        
        ## Hacking
        
        You'll want to install the developer dependencies:
        
        ```
        pip install -e .[develop]
        ```
        
        This will include `nose2` which is the test runner of choice. After you make modifications you can run tests with
        
        ```
        nose2
        ```
        
        When you're satisfied you'll want to update the version number and do build-and-upload:
        
        ```
        python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        twine upload dist/* --verbose
        ```
