    r"""A domain is a generalized type for homogeneous sets.

    It's not iterable because some sets are not iterable (e.g. the open
    interval ``(0-1)``).  There's also no notion of 'the next element'.
    Domains can also represent infinite sets (which are not representable by
    Python's sets).

    All values of a domain are of the same type `T`.  It's an error to mix
    domains of different types of values (``T``) in the operations below.

        `~xotless.domains.IntervalSet`:class: comprising only open ranges
        cannot produce a sample.  They return None.
