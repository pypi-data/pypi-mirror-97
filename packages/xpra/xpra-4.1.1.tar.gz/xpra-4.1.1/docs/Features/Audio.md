Unless you disable audio forwarding, you can start and stop it from the [system tray](./System-Tray.md) at any time.

The client and server will negotiate which codec to use. The most widely tested and supported codecs are [opus](http://opus-codec.org/), [vorbis](http://www.vorbis.com/), [flac](https://xiph.org/flac/) and mp3.

Unlike screen updates which are sent as discrete events, audio compression processes the operating system's audio **stream** and so this is a continuous process which will take up a little bit of CPU and bandwidth.

If you want to turn off speaker forwarding, use the option `speaker=off` in your system wide `xpra.conf` (to disable it globally) or in the per-user [configuration](../Usage/Configuration.md) file, or on the command line


# Controls
The main controls can be specified in the configuration file or on the command line, and they are documented in the [manual](https://xpra.org/manual.html):
* `speaker=on|off|disabled` / `microphone=on|off|disabled`: audio input and output forwarding control: _on_ will start the forwarding as soon as the connection is established, _off_ will require the user to enable it via the menu, disabled will prevent it from being used and the menu entry will be disabled
* `speaker-codec=CODEC` / `microphone-codec=CODEC`: Specify the codec(s) to use for audio output (speaker) or input (microphone). This parameter can be specified multiple times and the order in which the codecs are specified defines the preferred cod
ec order. Use the special value ’help’ to get a list of options. When unspecified, all the available codecs are allowed and the first one is used.
* `sound-source=PLUGIN[:OPTIONS]`: Specifies the GStreamer sound plugin used for capturing the sound stream. This affects "speaker forwarding" on the server, and "microphone" forwarding on the client. To get a list of options use the special value _h
elp_. It is also possible to specify plugin options using the form ` "--sound-source=SOURCE:name1=value1,name2=value2,etc"`, ie: `"--sound-source=pulse:device=device.alsa_input.pci-0000_00_14.2.analog-stereo"`

# Advanced Controls
Other controls are only available through environment variables for fine tuning - which should rarely be needed:
* `XPRA_PULSEAUDIO_DEVICE_NAME` to use a specific device if there is more than one device to choose from (can happen when using an existing pulseaudio server with more than one output device attached)
* `XPRA_SOUND_QUEUE_TIME` can be used to control the default amount of buffering by the receiver
* `XPRA_SOUND_GRACE_PERIOD` (defaults to `2000`, in milliseconds) errors will be ignored during this grace period after starting audio forwarding, to allow the audio forwarding buffer to settle down
* `XPRA_SOUND_SINK`: the default sink to use (normally auto-detected)
