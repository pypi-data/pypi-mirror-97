# Usage
Simply specify which pixel bit depth you want to use when starting a session, ie:
```shell
xpra start --pixel-depth=30
```

# Support
* [seamless mode](../Usage/Seamless.md) (aka `xpra start`) supports bit depths 16,24 and 30
* [desktop mode](../Usage/StartDesktop.md) (aka `start-desktop`) supports 8,16,24 and 30
* the native client `xpra attach` supports 16,24,30,48

Testing that high bit depth is actually in use can be tricky, for that the `xpra toolbox` provides a test application.


# Limitations
* the operating system and display must be configured for deep colour support
* transparency is supported in 24-bit mode, which is in effect a 32-bit mode
* with versions older than 4.1, 30-bit rendering is only supported in the [opengl enabled client](./Client-OpenGL.md), and only the `rgb` encoding will preserve high bit depth
* 16-bit mode has no real native encoders and so the pixels are often upsampled to 24-bit before compression which is wasteful
* 8-bit mode is not optimized at all
* see also [DPI](./DPI.md)
