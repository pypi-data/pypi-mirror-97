By default, the xpra server will advertise the session it creates on the local network using [Multicast DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS).

To turn off this feature, use the `mdns=no` option.

# Usage
To view the list of sessions, run:\
   `xpra list-mdns`

To use the GUI mdns session launcher, run:\
   `xpra mdns-gui`

The user interface should look like this:
![mdns gui](https://xpra.org/images/mdns-gui.png)

And you should be able to connect to those sessions simply by pressing the "connect" button.
