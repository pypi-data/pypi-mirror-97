<h1 class="top">Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>To provide this timestamping service in a trustworthy manner, the
service <b>irrevocably</b> creates, maintains, and publishes a log
file of its timestamping activity.</p>

<p>Therefore, the service <b>records and publishes the following information permanently and irrevocably</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>commit ID</b> of all the commits you requested timestamping
	for, in the sequence it was processed. This sequence, together
	with the timestamps on the log, will also give insight into the
	timestamp returned.<br/>
	<b>Not</b> stored will be the IDs of the documents within your
	repository.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to maintain the service, we record the following information for up to 7 days, <b>after which it will be deleted:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>For all requests:</b> Time, IP address, and URL of the request.</li>
<li><b>For branch timestamps:</b> The ID of the timestamping branch's previous
	HEAD commit ("parent") and the SHA-1 hash of the
	<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects">GIT
	tree object</a>. (In addition to time, IP address, URL, and
	commit ID).</li>
<li><b>For tag timestamps:</b> The name of the tag.
	(In addition to time, IP address, URL, and commit ID).</li>
</ul>
